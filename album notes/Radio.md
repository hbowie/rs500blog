Brian: 

Really enjoyed this record. Rap with a sense of humor and style. Favorite track: “Untitled”. Those ingredients, naked and acapella. Makes you miss the boys on the corner with the boombox. 


Charlie: 

Funny record. Fun and although I get tired of it being the same empty sound, “Rock The Bells” rocks out. 


Body: 

Brash, youthful, full of attitude, stripped-down rap putting the emphasis on clever lyrics and a minimalist sound. Just enough variety in the vocals and the lyrics and the rhythms to prevent it from being too repetitive. A great feel.
