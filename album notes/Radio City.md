Brian: 

Not awful, but kinda ‘meh’. I am sure this made it as it is considered an early power-pop record, but really don’t see how this one made it this high on this list. Track pick: “September Gurls”.


Charlie: 

I personally like the other Big Star record more but this one is alright. Second half of the album really takes off. Track choice is “Daisy Glaze”.


Body: 

A sweet-sounding album. Thematic content is pretty much summed up in the following lyrics, taken from "What's Going Ahn":

> I like love but I don't know:  
> All these girls, they come and go;  
> Always nothing left to say.
