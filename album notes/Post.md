Brian: 

What a force. Björk blended a variety of styles here to come up with something very original and very listenable. I was glad to hear this again, after maybe not giving it it’s due when it first came out. I love her rendition of the classic "It's Oh So Quiet", but I try not to pick covers, so going with ‘Possibly Maybe’.


Charlie: 

This is one of my favorite albums from the list thus far. It’s one of the most perfect albums because you don’t ever get bored. So much variety and everything sounds great, so I can’t choose just one. Truly loved this record. 


Body: 

Icelandic electronic singer-songwriter pop. Love/lust/loneliness. Modernity/nature. Nice variety of songs and musical approaches, pretty inventive and plenty appealing. Particularly liked “I Miss You”.
