Brian: 

Wow, what a fantastic album. I remember listening to Speakerboxxx/The Love Below when it first came out, but had never listened to Aquamini. So many great songs and I love the DJ-like intros. Still sounds creative and original. My pick: “Liberation”, but easily five or six great songs here.


Charlie: 

This was a surprisingly good album. Being a drummer, I always look at beats and/or grooves and the beats made on this album are great and propel the album. I love this album and it was a great start to the 500. Will definitely get a second listen. 


Body: 

I guess the beauty of Rap -- and, more broadly, of much of the music made by African Americans -- is that is starts with the most basic language, and experiences -- words and events most often viewed by white Euro-American culture as “common” -- and then uses those as building blocks to create lasting artistic works of great beauty, sophistication and power. Robert Johnson, Duke Ellington, OutKast -- there’s a single thread running through all of them. I love the overall sound of this album and its sprawling intensity, as well as its verbal sophistication. I think “Synthesizer” might be my favorite track.
