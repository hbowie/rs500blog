Brian: 

There is one good song on this record... “I’m Eighteen”. Skip the rest. 

Charlie: 

Not my favorite music ever but there’s some cool songs and obviously I’m Eighteen is a classic. The baby talking to it’s mom and coopers screaming are what annoy me... favorite songs: first one and the last one on the record. Especially the last one though.


Body: 

Not really a fan. Don't like the music, don't like the lyrics, don't like the vocals. I find it interesting as a cultural artifact, in the same way that an archaeologist might be interested in something turned up in a dig. Wow! People listened to this? And bought it? Just imagine!
