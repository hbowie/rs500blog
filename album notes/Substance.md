Joy Division/New Order were certainly one of the most influential bands for me as my musical tastes were formed in the 80’s. This album is hard to track down on streaming services, likely due to the fact that it was a compilation of singles and b-sides from the bands early 12” EPs. It is the companion to a similar singles compilation by Joy Division, also entitled Substance. So many great songs to pick from on an album full of great tracks, but so hard to resist ‘Blue Monday’. Sweated away quite a few evenings to that one dancing at The Vogue in the late 80’s.
