Brian: 

Peak Cheap Trick. A fun live record, full of that late ‘70’s rock vibe. Track pick has to be the simple classic which has become a staple in karaoke bars from Budokan and beyond, “I Want You to Want Me.” 


Charlie: 

Fun record. Energetic. “Ain’t that a shame” is my pic. 


Body: 

This is certainly Cheap Trick at their best. Their live show here is energetic and dynamic, yet finely honed to optimize their delivery, without any fluff or waste. There's not a dud among the ten tracks. Drums, vocals and guitars all work together perfectly. You can tell that this is a set that has been played and refined to perfection on the road by a band that just loves to play live. The screaming Japanese teenagers in the background sort of add to the fun, without getting in the way of the music. Since this was their breakthrough album in the states, its inclusion was probably mandatory, but it's a worthwhile addition to the list.
