Charlie: 

This is a really cool album. I had always heard of them and was into the stuff I heard of theirs and I knew of this album but definitely cool stuff. A lot of solid songs on here but “Lay Low” wins for me.


Body: 

Really a lovely album. Eminently listenable. "Gideon" is one of my favorite tracks.
