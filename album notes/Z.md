Brian: 

A wonderful record which is both original and listenable. It likely belongs higher up on this list. So many great songs here, but I am going to go with “Gideon”.

Charlie: 

This is a really cool album. I had always heard of them and was into the stuff I heard of theirs and I knew of this album but definitely cool stuff. A lot of solid songs on here but “Lay Low” wins for me.


Body: 

Really a lovely album. Eminently listenable. "Gideon" is one of my favorite tracks.
