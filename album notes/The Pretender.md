Brian: 

A solid album of grounded, heartfelt songs of the American experience. Sounds of a time. Track pick, “Your Bright Baby Blues”.


Charlie: 

I love this batch of albums. Lots of good ones. “Your Bright Baby Blues” is my favorite Jackson Browne song of all-time, but I’ll go with “Daddy’s Tune”.


Body: 

I'm a big Jackson Browne fan, but this album has never really done it for me. For one, I don't think it's a great batch of songs. For another, I don't think the sound of the album is very distinctive: it just sounds like a bunch of SoCal studio musicians working to churn out something commercial. And, finally, Browne's work on this album doesn't really seem to cohere into any definite commitment: what, exactly, is he trying to do or say? This album just seems to be sort of an awkward pause in his career, while he was trying to gather his strength to move on to something more definite. And so, I am not convinced it even belongs on this list. However, given that it was produced by Jon Landau, and that it had some modest commercial success, I guess it was inevitable that it would find its way on here somewhere.
