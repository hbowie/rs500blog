An amazing record, with an iconic classic as the lead-off song in ‘My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)’. But for my track I am going with the cinematic ‘Pocahontas’.


Body: 

Pablo Picasso supposedly said that "Good artists copy, great artists steal." And so I suppose it is appropriate that the name of this album comes from a phrase that Devo vocalist Mark Mothersbaugh threw into Young's song during a one-time performance of it, and that it is a phrase that Mark in turn appropriated from his former graphics arts career when he was promoting the product Rust-Oleum. 

I point this out because Neil Young is one of the few figures in rock who indubitably deserves the title of "artist," and also because Young in some ways reminds me of Picasso. Without belaboring the comparison, Young is someone who never doubted that he wanted an entire career creating new music, and also someone who was smart about what it would take to accomplish such an ambition. He realized that he could never repeat himself, that he could never worry about what other people expected from him, and that he would have to avoid traveling in herds. 

This particular album has a clever and unique construction. Most of it was initially recorded live, with later overdubs in the studio. The first side is acoustic, and the second side electric. And the album starts and ends with what are essentially two different versions of the same song, with the lyrics "It's better to burn out than to fade away" and "It's better to burn out than to rust." 

Part of Young's special genius is his ability to write lyrics that are simple and evocative and suggestive, without feeling the need to explain or to spell things out, letting his vocals and his guitar add emotional resonance to the words. The song that begins and ends the album is a great example of this, using very few, very simple words, and yet speaking volumes about what it means to be an artist who is using an industry while at the same time being used by it. 

The unspoken truth here is that Young was selecting "None of the above" from the multiple-choice selection he put together, indicating that, while it was better to burn out than to rust or fade away (as he no doubt considered that many of his peers were doing) he was going to do his level best to do none of the three. 

And this odd and wise and beautiful album was one way of his stamping "Paid" on that promise.
