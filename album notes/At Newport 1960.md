This was one of the first live blues albums ever recorded. Muddy and his bandmates are at their best. The incomparable Otis Spann on piano is especially enjoyable, James Cotton on harmonica is also great, and drummer Francis Clay provides a propulsive beat. Muddy's vocals are powerful and expressive. The set includes many of the artist's best known numbers (although "I Got My Brand on You" and "Tiger in Your Tank" are a couple of Willie Dixon numbers that might be best forgotten). The audience is pretty restrained at the beginning of the set, but seems to unwind a bit as the show progresses. Not bad, but if I had to recommend one Muddy Waters album, it would be *Fathers and Sons*.
