Brian: 

A fun record with some classics, but also a reminder that classic bands were not always classy. Some duds here too. Track pick has to be ‘Take It Easy’.

Charlie: 

I’ve definitely heard this record before but still a classic. This album was better than I expected; good songs all around. “Most of us are sad” is my pick.


Body: 

Jackson Browne's "Take It Easy" is still a stand-out classic. "Witchy Woman" is just annoying. The rest of the album is pretty listenable.
