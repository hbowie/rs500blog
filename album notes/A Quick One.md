Brian: 

Was really looking forward to listening to this one, seeing it pop up on the list. But have to say, it was kind of ‘meh’. Just not the quality of songwriting I think other Who albums represent. Track pick, ‘A Quick One’. 


Charlie: 

Yeah, they rock. “A Quick One” is way better live but it's alright here. “Sad About Us” is always my favorite off of this album but i’ll go with “Don’t Look Away”. Watch the Rock N Roll Circus version of “A Quick One”; it changed my life when I heard it.


Body: 

I don’t really think this album belongs on this list. It’s not a great album, although it has some likable oddities on it, such as “Boris the Spider.” Also not sure whether we should take “Happy Jack” into consideration as part of this album. Apple Music only has the Bonus Track Version, including a bunch of stuff that wasn’t on the original album, but omitting “Happy Jack,” which AllMusic lists as the last track on the album. In any case, though, my recommendation is to get the compilation “Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy,” which includes all The Who singles preceding *Who’s Next*, which was really the first Who album that should be considered for this list (IMHO).
