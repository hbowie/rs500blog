Brian: 

From the first beats this record had me groovin’ and thinking about dimmin’ the lights and making a move. A bit of funk, a bit of disco, really fun. Track pick: “Shining Star” is just a classic from its time. 


Charlie: 

Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! I will give a virtual high five to whoever can name all the time signatures on “See the light.” Whine album is great and I’m glad it’s here. Much deserved. To be honest I’m glad this was here so I have something to remember this band by besides “shining star” and “September”. 


Body: 

Sanctified soul testifying to the power of love, especially when accompanied by angelic vocal harmonies and funked-up beats.
