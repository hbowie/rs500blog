Brian: 

A somber, but very good album. Can get a little monotonous in tone. Favorite track is ‘The Late Show’. 


Charlie: 

Different from the other two on here which is nice. A little repetitive but definitely still some great lyrics; all mostly slow songs. “The Late Show” is my pick. 


Body: 

This is one of the greatest albums ever composed and recorded, so its placement at only # 375 on this list is a sad indication of the values of the critics doing the ratings.
