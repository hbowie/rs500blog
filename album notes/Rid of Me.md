Brian: 

A solid record, though not her best. Her talent is, however, abundantly clear. Track pick: i will go with the title track ‘Rid Of Me’.


Charlie: 

It's okay, not a big fan of it. A lot of it sounds the same. “Highway 61 Revisited” is the most different and exciting track in my opinion. 

Body: 

This early release from PJ Harvey expresses a litany  of raw, violent, primitive thoughts and emotions in a professionally produced punk package. It's intentionally extreme. A cover of Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited" sits in the center of the album, acting, I guess, as a sort of belated warning to those who enter here. Chalk this up as Harvey's "I-thought-I-wanted-love-but-good-god-not-this" coming of age punk epistle. Everyone's entitled to one, and this is a good one, but I'm also glad Harvey was able to successfully move beyond this stage with her later work.
