Brian: 

A really fun record to listen to loud, a great seventies glam rock sound. Track pick: ‘Whizz Kid”. 

Charlie: 

Another good Mott album. Glad I was introduced to this band through this list. Track pick is “Honaloochie Boogie”.


Body: 

A fine album that embodies the spirit of rock'n roll while at the same time pointing out all of its disappointments. "All the Way from Memphis" is an upbeat rocker, and probably my favorite listen, but "Ballad of Mott the Hoople" is the classic track that lays out the whole story of the band's faded dreams without resorting to either anger, finger-pointing or self-pity.
