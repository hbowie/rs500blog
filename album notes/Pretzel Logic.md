Brian: 

A really fun record to listen to. Steely Dan is one of those bands I always liked but never really wanted to admit to anyone. I listened to Donald Fagen’s The Nightfly in high school on heavy rotation. Good music you can relax to. Doesn’t test, but teases you in with clever lyrics and solid music. My pick here is “Any Major Dude Will Tell You”.


Charlie: 

Man oh man oh man. This might be my new favorite steely dan record. Katy Lied has always been my top but I think this just took the cake. “Barrytown” is my pick, but you really can’t do wrong with any of these songs. Will definitely be listening again. 


Body: 

Jazzy, but nothing crazy. Goes down smooth. Absolutely great album cover. “Rikki Don’t Lose That Number” is just a classic track, in addition to being an unforgettable hit. Hard not to like.
