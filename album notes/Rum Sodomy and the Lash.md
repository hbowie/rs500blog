This was the second album from this Irish folk-punk band. It was produced by Elvis Costello, who said "I saw my taskâ€¦ was to capture them in their dilapidated glory." This is a rich, rough, vital album. Every song has something to say, and says it powerfully and originally. Like the work of Fairport Convention and Richard Thompson, it builds respectfully on deep musical traditions, but uses those traditions to tell modern tales as well as timeless ones. Pretty much essential listening.
