Brian: 

One of those artists and albums that I know is good, but which I do not quite connect with. I am sure I would love this band live, but listening to the album, only a few songs caught me, including “Dirty Old Town”. 


Charlie: 

Not my music but I respect it. “A Pair of brown eyes” is pretty cool. Cool album overall just not my cup of tea. 

Body: 

This was the second album from this Irish folk-punk band. It was produced by Elvis Costello, who said "I saw my task… was to capture them in their dilapidated glory." This is a rich, rough, vital album. Every song has something to say, and says it powerfully and originally. Like the work of Fairport Convention and Richard Thompson, it builds respectfully on deep musical traditions, but uses those traditions to tell modern tales as well as timeless ones. Pretty much essential listening.
