Still sounds fresh, energized, sincere and authentic to me. The music is so strong and determined that it belies the emotional desolation expressed in many of the lyrics,   but that somehow only adds to the overall charm of the album. Their later work would become more sophisticated, but I'm not sure it ever got any better. "Peanuts" is an amusing reaction to the evolution of Rod Stewart's musical career, although it's not clear that Sting himself appreciated this perspective once he too evolved from a young brash outsider to claim his own place in the pop music pantheon.
