Brian: 

Listening to this reminded me of one of those dates you went on when you were young. She’s cute, and fun, but after ten minutes of trying to seem into her all you can think of is how are you going to get out of here. “She Bop” is actually the best song on this record, even if it was not the hit that “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” and “Time after Time” were. 


Charlie: 

lotta hits on here… lotta hits. Again, not an 80s fan but I definitely appreciate the music. I should’ve written that for the other ones I didn’t like… so read it now: I APPRECIATE THE MUSIC AND RESPECT IT EVEN IF I DON’T LIKE THE ALBUM. Good record any song on here will give you the vibe of it. Which in my opinion isn’t a great thing, but hey that’s my opinion. There are plenty of people who love this stuff. That’s why it was famous and is on the top 500. 


Body: 

The production and instrumentation sound a bit dated today, but there are several things about this album that I just love: the cover photo by Annie Liebovitz, taken at Coney Island; the title of the album; and Lauper’s girlish, saucy vocals. And then there are “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” and “Time After Time.” These just strike me as absolutely classic tracks that still stand out as unique and powerful artistic expressions. My favorite lines: “Some boys take a beautiful girl / And hide her away from the rest of the world / I want to be the one to walk in the sun.” Yes indeed. Walk on, girl.
