Brian: 

We have been having a debate here during this project about the value of compilations and ‘best ofs’. This album to me proves the exception to the rule. A great album that help one explore some phenomenal music that may otherwise be hard for western ears to get ahold of. Loved it. A favorite? I’ll take ‘Thul’ulalele’ since it reminds me of my niece Thulile. I hope this song is about something sweet, caring, and smart like she is! (But I need some language support here to know for sure.) [and yes, this is an Easter Egg for Thulile. Hey!]


Charlie: 

Yeah, I agree with B. this settles the debate of value of compilation albums as does the Temptations one. Love this record a lot. This is what Paul Simon fell in love with and then made “Graceland” based off of. Ladysmith Black Mambazo is even the closing track. My pick here is “Emthonjeni Womculo”, but you can’t really go wrong with any of these. 


Body: 

A fun album. Lots of cool sounds. Drums, guitars, vocals. Of course I have no idea what they're singing about, but they seem to be pretty happy about it. Infectious. I have no idea how anyone made the decision to put this above # 389, but below # 387, but I guess that's why the critics at Rolling Stone make the big bucks. (This is one placement I won't try to second-guess.)
