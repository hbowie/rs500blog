Brian: 

Was not at all familiar with this record. Very listenable, but then again so is a barely memorable Spotify playlist like “Cafe Americana”. Strong hints of Dylan and Cohen. Track pick” “Nothing but the Wheel”. 


Charlie: 

Good music. Not a fan of his voice. 

Body: 

A bracing jolt of Americana, featuring fiddle, pedal steel and mandolin alongside horns, harmonica, guitars, piano, organ, bass and drums. And a rich batch of original material, expressing mature reflections on a long life fully lived. If that's not enough, you can hear Mick Jagger's backing vocals in places, adding some depth and texture to Wolf's vocals. Surprisingly intimate production, with Wolf's vocals always clearly front and center, and with the rich and varied instrumentation playing a clear supporting role. Good stuff.
