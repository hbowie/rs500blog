Brian: 

I absolutely love this record. Well crafted, hooky, solemn songs reflecting on love and growth. The track pick here is difficult as it is such as well balanced album, but going to go with “Guess I’m Doing Fine” as it so well sums up the record.

Charlie: 

This is a cool album. Nice and mellow but exciting; a great vibe here. Favorite songs are “The Golden Age” and “Little One”.

Body: 

A perfectly lovely, quiet, mostly subdued, break-up album. A nice listen, but I can't say that anything stood out as being particularly memorable.
