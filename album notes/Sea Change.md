Brian: 

I absolutely love this record. Well crafted, hooky, solemn songs reflecting on love and growth. The track pick here is difficult as it is such as well balanced album, but going to go with “Guess I’m Doing Fine” as it so well sums up the record. 

Body: 

A perfectly lovely, quiet, mostly subdued, break-up album. A nice listen, but I can't say that anything stood out as being particularly memorable.
