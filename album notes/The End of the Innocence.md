Brian: 

Another album that connects to the heavy influence MTV had in the late ‘80s. A solid album from a solid artist, but in the end seems very forgettable. Best song here for me is ‘New York Minute’.


Charlie: 

End of the 80s yet sounds as 80s as they all do. Kinda weird to hear an Eagles singer putting his voice with drum machines and hard rock and roll. But then again, Elvis Costello has done a jazz album and classical ones too and he pulled those off. Henley does the same here. “Shangri-La” is my pick.


Body: 

Bruce Hornsby co-wrote the title track, and plays keyboards on it, which is probably why I like it so much. That opening track seems to have a quiet elegance to it that seems to be sadly missing from the rest of the album, which is a bit of a mish-mash. Probably my least favorite track is “I Will Not Go Quietly,” which succeeded in making me wish he would. I admire songwriters and recording artists that pack a lot of stuff into compact packages. The approach here seems to be the opposite: start with a lot of weak material, over-produce it, and stretch each track out until the listener begs for mercy. Plus, it’s unforgivable for Henley to offer up a song titled “Shangri-La” as if that song title had not already been admirably taken by The Kinks, whose earlier song of the same title is worth about ten of Henley’s.
