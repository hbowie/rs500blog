Brian: 

Great rock. Perfect for a sunny day and some cold beer. Some classic tracks here. Was never really into ZZ Top, but these songs conjure up those… um… memorable music videos of the ‘80’s. Track pick has to be the one that most conjured up those memories: “Legs”


Charlie: 

Haha I love how the genre is “hard rock”. Definitely rocks. It's fun. Cool album. “Legs” is my pick as well (this is one of the few times anyone has agreed on the same top song; funny how that is the case).


Body: 

Big hits. Smash album. Fuzz-tone blues guitar with synths underneath. Driving rhythms. Catchy songs. Eh. Not much to stick to this boy's ribs, though. As forgettable as it is listenable.
