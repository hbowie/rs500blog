Brian: 

At the point of listening to this one, I got stuck. I was holding up this whole project because of my reluctance to listen to this one… and… it was not so bad. He has had much worse, which is why I was reluctant, but in the end - while it may not be my favorite - I can handle it. Pick: “Underneath the Harlem Moon” 


Charlie: 

Classic Newman. Loved it. Great drumming on here by Jim Gordon/Gene Parsons. I like “Lucinda” but can’t go wrong with the classic “Old Kentucky Home”. 


Body: 

Newman gets a nice, rootsy sound on this album with help from musicians like Ry Cooder, Clarence White and Jim Gordon, as well as his own vocals and piano-playing. It's interesting that the album cover suggests the idea of sitting down and watching television -- it's hard to imagine that Newman at this early stage in his life could have imagined how many children and parents would be listening to his music while doing just that at this later stage -- but I think it does indicate Newman's interest in using song to tell a wide variety of simple and often silly stories about characters he's made up. A strong showing overall, and Newman's original composition "Mama Told Me Not To Come" gets my pick as the stand-out track, even if the inferior version by Three Dog Night has been played about a million times too often.
