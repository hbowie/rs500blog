Charlie: 

Was expecting a better album but some good songs on here. A lot of weird ones though. Favorite song is “Synchronicity 2” as well as the other synchronicity.


Body: 

There are reasons why this album shows up on this list, but they aren't good ones. Sure, it was a big seller, and it's got more than its fair share of hits, but you have to wade through a lot of dross before you get to the good stuff — all of which you've probably already heard a million times. "Mother" is comically bad, in a Frank Zappa-ish sort of way. Not sure how an album like this belongs on a "Best" list.
