Brian: 

A crazy record. At times brilliant, at times just surreal. But I think everyone should listen to it. Hearing these voices and melodies of the earlier Beach Boys reconfigured and compiled into this menagerie is fascinating. Track pick, have to go with “Good Vibrations.”


Charlie: 

Feels like I’m inside Brian Wilson’s mind. Some amazing moments and some whacky ones; that's why we love Brian Wilson . ”Heroes and Villains” is my pick.


Body: 

This is not so much a great album as it is a bunch of recording sessions for an album that was once supposed to have been great. “Heroes and Villains” and “Good Vibrations” were undeniably great tracks, but they were first released on the album *Smiley Smile* back in 1967. This collection is certainly interesting in a lot of ways, but its presence on this list is more about how much rock critics have invested in the legend of the great lost *Smile* album over the years than about any attributes of this particular collection of recordings.
