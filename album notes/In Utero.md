Certainly a great album. The sound often approaches a sort of raw abrasiveness, but it's carried along by the strength of the songs, and the vocals and instruments are always perfectly expressive. There's also enough variety here to make the album work as a sequence. Thematically, it's an honest statement from a rocker realizing he's outgrown his youth and has achieved a certain level of success, yet rejects all the models available to him of what it means to be a successful adult. How thoroughly Kurt Cobain rejected those models would only become tragically apparent a bit later.
