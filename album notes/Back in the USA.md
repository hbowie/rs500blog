Easy album I love it. Fun and energetic. Favorite song was “teenage lust”

Body: 

Sort of a proto-punk album from the Motor City Five, going back to basics, including bookending covers of Little Richard’s “Tutti Frutti” and Chuck Berry’s “Back to the USA.” Energetic and listenable, and of some historic significance. Produced by famed Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau, who went on to discover the future of Rock’n Roll in Bruce Springsteen a few years later (perhaps after he grew bored out of his mind listening to the MC5).
