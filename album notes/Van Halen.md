Brian: 

A true junior high throwback for me. In a way I rebelled against the popularity of bands like Van Halen that so many of my peers took as the default music of our pubescence. But time gives us an opportunity to hear back with fresh ears, and this not only a lot of fun, but is actually quite good. Well produced big-hair, big-guitar rock, and surprisingly decent songs all around. This album of course includes a few fantastic covers, including the Kinks “You Really Got Me” and John Brim‘s “Ice Cream Man”, but the highlight for me has to be “Feel Your Love Tonight”.


Charlie: 

Fun album. Not a huge van halen fan but iconic album nonetheless. “You Really Got Me” is a fun cover. 

Body: 

A lot of fun, with smooth background singing, assertive lead vocals, plenty of guitar pyrotechnics, a driving rhythm section, and some punchy, memorable songs that quickly get in, do their stuff, and get out. "Little Dreamer" was a standout track for me, and one I hadn't heard before.
