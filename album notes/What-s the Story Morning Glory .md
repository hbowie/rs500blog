Brian: 

Some good tracks here, but this is not even close to The Stone Roses, which was a lot lower on this list and which in my book formed the sound Oasis leveraged heavily. I don’t think this is really a great record. Track pick here is ‘Wonderwall’ even if their original rendition is not the best one out there, which I think is probably Ryan Adam’s version. I think this one of those records that was very popular for a time (like when the list was edited) and doesn't really hold up. 


Charlie: 

It’s pretty good. An okay band with a pretty good vocalist. Songwriting isn’t that amazing either. “Don’t look back in anger” is my pick. 


Body: 

I can see how this thing might grow on you. "Cast No Shadow" was my favorite track. And "She's Electric" was also quite appealing. 

On the other hand I can easily see how one could live a long and happy and rather complete life without ever hearing a single note from this album. 

I wouldn't exactly call it essential listening. Great? Well, OK. I guess. It certainly sold quite well back in the day.
