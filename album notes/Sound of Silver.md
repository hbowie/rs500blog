Brian: 

Great to see LCD Soundsystem make the list. A solid record and no doubt very influential on a whole host of late aughts bands. Very listenable electronica. Favorite track here is definitely “Someone Great”, but the album is filled with great tracks incl “North American Scum” and “All My Friends”.


Charlie: 

Cool record. Almost sounds late to the party in the sense of electronic music (although the last song isn’t very electronic). “North American Scum” is my track pick. 


Body: 

A lot of fun. Very listenable electronic music. Cool stuff. "North American Scum" is hard to resist.
