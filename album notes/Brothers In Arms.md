Brian: 

Enjoyed this one. I may have dismissed these songs from overplay, but gained more appreciation. These guys were so subtly clever. Nice to listen to a whole album to get more immersed in that. Track pick has to be ‘Why Worry’ which feels very appropriate given our times.


Charlie: 

I’ve never been an 80s guy but I liked this record cause it wasn’t straight 80s; had some 60s/70s rock influence in there which was cool. Lead singer’s voice reminds me of John Hiatt which helps too. B stole my top pick so I’ll go with “So Far Away”.

Body: 

I love "Money for Nothing" and "Walk of Life", but the rest of the album doesn't do a lot for me. The keyboards and the horns mostly just seem to be there to add color, without much musical originality, and the whole thing seems a bit overproduced. But hey, this was their "breakthrough" album and sold a ton, so I guess that's why it's on the list.
