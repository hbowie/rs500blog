Brian: 

At first I was wondering why this album was so far down the list, then I realized I was listening to the U.S. release instead of the U.K. release. So I switched over. Still a decent record, but missing some of the iconic Stones tracks, and definitely a few duds. A reminder that great bands also have some misses along the way. Going with ‘Who’s Been Sleeping Here?’

Charlie: 

Not 100% sure why this is on here out of all the Stones records there are but it’s here on the list, so therefore we listen. “Miss Amanda Jones” is my pick. 

Body: 

Although it feels like the Stones have been around forever, and have staked out a certain ground for that entire time, the band actually went through a number of transformations over its first decade or so. Brian Jones was neither lead singer nor songwriter, but his eclectic musical interests and multi-instrumental capabilities were a strong influence on the group's sound for a few years and, as a result, this album features less of the blues-based rock that the Stones were known for a bit earlier, as well as later. The combination of Brian's musical embellishment with some solid originals penned by Jagger and Richards make this a stand-out album in the group's catalog. It's hard to believe now, but "Let's Spend the Night Together" was considered too explicit for many media outlets when it came out in '67, and spelling this request out was one of the many things that gave the Stones a reputation for being "bad boys" compared to The Beatles.
