Brian: 

A good album. Easy to forget how hard this band rocked. I think their success masked some of their quality for me. Enjoyed this one. Track pick: ‘Today’


Charlie: 

I didn’t think I would like this record, but it's good. Great guitar sounds and yeah B’s right --  they do rock. There’s also a sort of jam aspect as well that creates cool vibes.  “Cherub Rock” and “Soma” are my favorites on the record. 

Body: 

Definitely quality stuff. Well done and consistent, with a well-defined sound. But I found it hard to emotionally engage with much of anything here. Some sample lyrics: "Alone and unhappy / I never liked me anyway / If by chance / Or circumstance / We should fail / Don't be so sad / Shot full of diamonds / And a million years / The disappointed disappear / Like they were never here." Alrighty, then. Next!
