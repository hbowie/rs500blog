This is mostly pretty listenable (except for "I Want You to Want Me", which is one of those hit songs that is so vacuous that it makes me want to stuff cotton in my ears whenever it starts) but there's not much here that rises to any kind of "best" status in my mind. If I had to pick one song to recommend, it would be "So Good To See You" which manages to be pleasantly reminiscent of both The Beatles and The Beach Boys.
