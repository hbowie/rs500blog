Brian: 

Sublime, beautiful, energetic, and atmospheric. Track pick is the first on the album as it sets such a tone, ‘Concierto de Aranjuez: Adagio’.


Charlie: 

Honestly am not a huge fan of his work with Gil Evans (aside from the amazing “Birth of the Cool”), and the first few times I listened to this it didn't really intrigue me but I gave it one final try and I like it. Not my favorite, but definitely an interesting and cool record. 

Body: 

A unique album, with Miles Davis playing his trumpet against the background of orchestration from Gil Evans. Lots of talent here, and lots to listen to, but it’s never been one of my favorite discs in the Miles catalog. Not really sure why it’s on this list, considering there are so many other great jazz albums to choose from, and so few included on this list.
