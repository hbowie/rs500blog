Brian: 

A great album of fast, well constructed songs. A great raw energy, mixed with a pop sensibility. Track pick is the ever hooky ‘Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone One You Shouldn't've)’.


Charlie: 

Fun album; great energy. Track picks are “promises” and “autonomy”. 

Body: 

Really great stuff. Energetic, witty. No dated political references (at least that I noticed). Cynical, but not nihilistic. I'm going to go with "Whatever Happened To...?" for my track pick.
