Brian: 

I just finished listening to the terrific Spotify audio documentary podcast series on The Clash, and there is a terrific episode covering the making of this record. These guys loved music and wanted to connect their audience to genres and musicians of all backgrounds. And they loved writing and playing. This record is a crazy, intoxicated masterpiece. Most of the songs were written on “the spliff couch” while the previous track was being mixed, and then they would step up and quickly record the next in long epic days with artists of all types dropping in. So many worthy tracks, but I am going to pick “The Magnificent Seven”. Essentially the first “white” rap track and an homage to the hip-hop and rap bands The Clash featured at their crazy standing gigs in Manhattan earlier that year. It was at those gigs that white audiences and critics first heard this crazy sound from Brooklyn and Queens from the likes of Grandmaster Flash. 

Charlie: 

cool album but for me, 36 clash songs is about 20 too many. I like normal album lengths. Still, some good moments despite some weird ones. “let’s go crazy” is my top. 


Body: 

A sort of magnum opus from The Clash, featuring 36 tracks of relentless musical invention and lyrics mostly on political themes. These are not all hits, but neither are they filler. A signature achievement.
