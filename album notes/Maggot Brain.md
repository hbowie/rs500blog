Brian: 

A really fun record. Enjoyed grooving to “Can You Get To That”.


Charlie: 

Trippy first song and the whole album for that matter. Classic album cover. Enjoyed the album. “hit it and quit it” wins for me. 


Body: 

Sort of a psychedelic funk sandwich, with two long mind-blowing cuts at the front and back, along with shorter R&B numbers in between. Definitely brings back that early-seventies feeling of coloring outside of all the lines. I especially liked "You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks."
