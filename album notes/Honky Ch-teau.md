Brian: 

Simply a great record. Hard to imagine why it is not higher on the list. Contains one of my all time favorite songs, ‘Rocket Man (I Think It’s Going To Be A Long, Long Time)’.

Charlie: 

Pretty good… “Amy” is my pick. 

Body: 

A tremendously accomplished album. Great songcraft; a wide variety of styles, subjects and moods; vocals and ivory-tickling from Elton that are always on point, always in service to the song; excellent accompaniment and musicianship from a bunch of vocalists and players. Every track is a joy. "Honky Cat" is my favorite of the bunch, but it's really hard to single one out.
