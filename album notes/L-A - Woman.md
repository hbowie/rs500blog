Brian: 

A classic and nice to sit and listen to the whole album and imagine the impact this album had when it was released in ‘71. ‘Riders On The Storm’ has to be the pick. 

Charlie: 

Great album. Classic. I like the vibes The Doors create. “Riders on the storm” is great but I’ll go with “The WASP”.

Body: 

There's a remarkable feel to this album. Despite the hit singles it contains, there's never a sense of pandering to an audience. Morrison here sounds like he's picking up the authentic *noir* mantle from L.A. authors such as Raymond Chandler and Ross McDonald, and spinning another, timeless tale about the city of lost angels. And yet he does this without feeling a need to either attract or repel us -- and he and his bandmates make some remarkable, compelling music along the way. "Riders on the Storm" has to be my favorite track.
