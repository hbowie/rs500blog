Brian: 

A fun, yet ultimately inconsistent record as a whole. Track pick has to be “Jet”, a sneaky, hooky tribute to the surfragettes.

Charlie: 

Love this album. So great from top to bottom. Favorite song is probably “Band on the Run” but I’ll give a shoutout to “Mamunia”. 

Body: 

A very companionable album. Paul has a knack for relaxed fun, and it's on full display in the grooves of this album.
