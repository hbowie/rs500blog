Brian: 

A complete album, and despite Waits’ unique voice and delivery, I never got tired throughout. Some tracks are chapters, while others establish the plot. Favorite track, “Get Behind The Mule”.


Charlie: 

Cool album. I dig it. His voice is annoying but the music itself is great. 


Body: 

Sixteen songs, over 70 minutes of music, and every moment worth listening to for its own sake, but also helping to build a sweeping panorama of human suffering, sorrow and redemption. As with few other albums on this list, these songs were not crafted to gain airplay, or to sell albums, or to start or follow any trends: each track is communicating some particular vision, some combination of words, thoughts and feelings that are bound together in such a way that they form a bond between singer and listener and subject — some human bond that we were not previously aware of and yet, once exposed, can no longer be denied. An album for the ages.
