Brian: 

Enjoyed this record a lot. At times a bit too much shock and gimmick, but the surrounding tracks are pretty awesome. Favorite track” C.R.E.A.M. 


Charlie: 

I respect them greatly and feel this list would be incomplete without them/their influence on the world. However, it's just personally not my cup of tea. “7th chamber part 2” is pretty good. This album is just a lot of the same music and too many long conversations for my own taste. But that's what people love about rap and these early 90s rap records, which is why I respect Wu-Tang Clan.


Body: 

Definitely a lot of talent on display here, and the mix of spoken dialogue, music and kung fu mythology is kind of cool. These guys were outsiders who wanted in without having to compromise with the traditional labels, and they were largely successful. You got to give it up for them.
