Brian: 

Really solid record, with great songwriting. I was not a huge fan when this record came out, but clearly I was not really listening. Almost hate to pick it, but it truly is an exceptional song, track pick: “Nothing Compares 2 U”


Charlie: 

I tried listening twice and wasn’t a fan. Onto the next one...


Body: 

An amazing album. A defining moment for women seeking to find their identities in the modern world. O'Connor's thorough self-possession is evident on every track. Her slow pacing, delicate vocals and restrained accompaniment all work together to make it clear that she is not here to entertain us, or to distract us, or seduce us, or to amuse us, or to bond with us, or to bring us down or pump us up: she's using words and music to express her thoughts and feelings, and invites us to listen or not, as we would like. Love and Death weave their ways through the tracks, as we would expect from a work with Celtic influences, but ultimately we are left with the story of a girl/woman making her way through the world, and becoming herself. Strong stuff.
