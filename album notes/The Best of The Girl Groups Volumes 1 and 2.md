Brian: 

Not sure how a compilation made it on this list. Hard to track down, so had to listen to a Spotify playlist that seems to be a noble attempt to recreate this album (thanks K.W.!). Some good songs here for sure, though it clearly shows how one dimensional girl groups were forced to be in their material. Track pick: “Leader of the Pack” by The Shangri-Las, as it nearly breaks free of those constraints. 

Charlie: 

Love this album. Favorite one is “The Boy From New York City” but all are great. Again though, another compilation. 

Body: 

This refers to a Rhino compilation released in 1990 that is no longer available. Some great artists, some great music, but hard to review or rate as an album.
