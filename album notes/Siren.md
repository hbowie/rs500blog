Brian: 

Such a great record, with an iconic song leading it off and that sexy pic of Jerry Hall on the album cover. Hall was Ferry’s girlfriend at the time. Have to go with that lead off track for the pick here… ‘Love Is The Drug’, with ‘Both Ends Burning’ a close second.


Charlie: 

Another great Roxy Music album… I'm very glad I’ve been introduced to this band through the 500 list. 


Body: 

The album's perfection is undeniable -- there's a wonderful consistency to the sound and the lyrics, every track is compelling, and there's not a misstep anywhere. Ferry's trademark vocal quaver is used to great effect. And there's certainly a tight thematic consistency throughout the album. 

On the other hand, there's not a single cell in my body that wishes to ever listen to this thing again. The music is too smooth for my tastes, and Ferry's self-absorption too complete. I just can't really find anything to grab onto. 

(And let me go on record here by saying that I think this is the silliest album cover I've ever seen -- even ignoring the fact that the subject is now wedded to Rupert Murdoch. Which means, I suppose, that "She Sells" will have to be my track pick.)
