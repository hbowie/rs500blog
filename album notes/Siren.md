Brian: 

Such a great record, with an iconic song leading it off and that sexy pic of Jerry Hall on the album cover. Hall was Ferry’s girlfriend at the time. Have to go with that lead off track for the pick here… ‘Love Is The Drug’, with ‘Both Ends Burning’ a close second.


Charlie: 

Another great Roxy Music album… I'm very glad I’ve been introduced to this band through the 500 list.
