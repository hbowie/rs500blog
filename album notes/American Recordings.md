Brian: 

Such a great record. Relaunched ‘the man in black’ to a whole new generation of fans. Astonishingly this was the 81st album of Cash’s prolific career, but the first to be produced by Rick Rubin, who deserves thanks from all of us for recording Cash in such an authentic way which reinvigorated Cash’s career and led to many more great albums. So many great songs here, but going with ‘The Man Who Couldn’t Cry’. 


Charlie: 

I wish I liked this more than I do. It’s good, just all the songs kinda have the same formula and for whatever reason it doesn’t resonate with me. Nonetheless, Johnny Cash is great and sounds great; the live tracks towards the end are fun too. My pick is “Why Me Lord”. 


Body: 

A real treat. Just Johnny's voice and guitar (and an appreciative studio audience at times) performing a well-chosen batch of songs. There are Cash originals, some singer-songwriter gems, and a few traditional numbers. But the album works so well because the artists involved (Cash and producer Rick Rubin) both agree on one thing: the importance of song to the American experience. Cash understands he's not there to make pretty sounds, but to tell stories with meaning and authenticity, stories that help to shape and inform character. And even though he manages to make it sound deceptively simple, there are damned few who were ever able to do it this well.
