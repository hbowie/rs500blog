Brian: 

Simply fantastic. Some great tracks here, including ‘Boom Boom’, ‘Teachin’ the Blues’, ‘One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer’ and many others, but my pick is ‘I’m Bad Like Jesse James’, which is essentially a spoken word blues classic. 


Charlie: 

Great music. It gets a little long but it’s good stuff. “Never get out of these blues Alive” is my pick.


Body: 

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to stream this Rhino collection via Apple Music, but the CD was easy to find on Amazon, so it was a good excuse to purchase this 2-disc set. I was familiar with Hooker of course, but had never owned one of his albums, and this collection was a revelation. I was already familiar with some of his biggest, most covered, songs, and with his “endless boogie” sound, but this collection makes it clear that he was so much more than any of that. He’s certainly one of the true originals in blues/R&B/rock, and one of the “this is where it all began” sources that inspired and influenced so many great artists who followed. Although he started with a solo guitar sound that was focused on a basic boogie rhythm that could be considered “primitive,” his vocals and persona were consistently more sophisticated and approachable -- even for a modern white audience -- than those of many of his blues contemporaries. Looking through the accompanying booklet, it’s interesting to see photos of him smoking a pipe, and sporting a series of fairly stylish *chapeaus*, and interesting to read that his favorite era was when he was able to sing and play his guitar in small coffeehouses. Great music, and a collection worth tracking down.
