Brian: 

Solid record, full of great guitar riffs, which was what the ‘rave-up’ refers to in the title of the album. Not sure it is The Yardbirds best, but definitely enjoyed it. Track pick: ‘Heart Full of Soul”.


Charlie: 

Cool. Didn’t realize the history of amazing lead guitarists they had. Side 1 is all Jeff Beck and side 2 is live with Clapton. Legendary.


Body: 

Some great originals, some great versions of blues standards, and some fun blues romps by the boys. "Heart Full of Soul" is a classic, but their amped-up version of the Bo Diddley song "I'm A Man" is probably my favorite track. These guys weren't messing around.
