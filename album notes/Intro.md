"C" is a drummer with an idea. Listen to Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time before he graduates high school in the spring of 2020. 

"B" is his uncle and thought, "Hmmm, sounds interesting, maybe I should listen to those too."
 
"H" is somehow related to both "C" and "B" but none of us can work out exactly how. "H" loves music and knows the early stuff. He wanted in. 

"C" was born in the 2000's. "B" was born in the 1960's. "H" was born in the 1950's.

We decided to record our thoughts and notes on the albums as we go along. Most of these are jots and hot-takes, and a way to record the process. We will not always agree, but that's kinda the point.

We have a lot to get through, so keep up.

About the RS 500.

The RS 500 was assembled by the editors of Rolling Stone, based on the results of two extensive polls. In 2003, Rolling Stone asked a panel of 271 artists, producers, industry executives and journalists to pick the greatest albums of all time. In 2009, they asked a similar group of 100 experts to pick the best albums of the 2000s. From those results, Rolling Stone created this new list of the greatest albums of all time.

We know this is biased to Western Culture, and we will not necessarily agree with all these even being on the list. But hey, it is a list. Letâ€™s get spinnin' and streamin'....
