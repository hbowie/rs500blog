Brian: 

Creative, with layers of production and storytelling. Track pick has to be “Tie My Hands”, a beautiful and meaningful rap song. 


Charlie: 

Love this album. Grew up listening to it with my mom always playing it. Favorite tracks are “Mr Carter” and “Let the Beat Build”. Whole album is great though. 


Body: 

This album is all over the place, pretty much in a good way. Very inventive in terms of rhymes, rhythms, vocalization and instrumentation. Won a Grammy for best Rap Album of the year. "Dr. Carter" is a lot of fun, and "Tie My Hands" is a very moving song about post-Katrina New Orleans.
