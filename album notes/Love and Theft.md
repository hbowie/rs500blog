Brian: 

So good. Track, “Mississippi”. 


Charlie: 

Great; loving this Dylan resurgence period (this is the one after “time out of mind”). My pick here is “Moonlight” (“Mississippi” is equally great).


Body: 

Not bad for late Dylan. This is one of the reasons why he was so deserving of the Nobel prize. This is not a great album, but damn, he’s an American poet, and he just keeps stringing words together in such an evocative way. “Mississippi” is a great example of his casual artistry. On the one hand it’s just Dylan reflecting on -- well, pretty much everything -- but he seems to speak in poetry as naturally as I fill out a grocery list. In the end, it’s another gift from our greatest contemporary American bard, and it’s just up to us to receive it gratefully.
