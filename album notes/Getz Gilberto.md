Charlie: 

So good. Love it. Great album. “Desafinado” wins for me but only cause “Girl from Ipanema” is the obvious choice from this album. Could listen to this every lazy Sunday afternoon.


Body: 

One of the best-selling jazz albums of all time, partially because of the hit single "The Girl from Ipanema." Also a bossa nova album. But despite all of the associations you might have with these things, it is a beautiful, lyrical album, thoroughly understated and sensuous. Definitely worth hearing in its entirety.
