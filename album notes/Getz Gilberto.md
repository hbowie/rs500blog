Brian: 

Such a great record. I have this on vinyl and love to put this one on in the summer as K and I play cards on the patio in the dappled afternoon sunlight, a good dry white wine on ice nearby. “The Girl From Ipanema” is such a perfect song, sexy and confident and sublime (which unfortunately gets played at low volume in elevators or home furnishings stores far too often), but I am going to pick “Corcovado (Quiet Nights Of Quiet Stars)”. An equally romantic, casually elegant song on an album full of them. 


Charlie: 

So good. Love it. Great album. “Desafinado” wins for me but only cause “Girl from Ipanema” is the obvious choice from this album. Could listen to this every lazy Sunday afternoon.


Body: 

One of the best-selling jazz albums of all time, partially because of the hit single "The Girl from Ipanema." Also a bossa nova album. But despite all of the associations you might have with these things, it is a beautiful, lyrical album, thoroughly understated and sensuous. Definitely worth hearing in its entirety.
