Brian: 

A great record. Almost ambient, but with a tension and energy that requires attention. Track pick: “Sky Saw”, as I can imagine Dalis Car took some inspiration from that song. 


Charlie: 

Wow…  2 Eno records within 4 spots on the list. Excited to get to this one deemed 3 places higher than the previous. 

Update: It’s pretty cool… I personally like the other one better but this is cool. Little more spacey but creates a cool mood. “Becalmed” is my favorite. 


Body: 

Highly regarded post-modern church music. Mostly slow, soothing instrumentals, with occasional singing. Certainly different, and certainly successful. A stepping stone that would take Eno from his earlier post-modern pop to his later full-on ambient albums. John Cale, Phil Collins and Robert Fripp are notable contributors.
