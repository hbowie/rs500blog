Highly regarded post-modern church music. Mostly slow, soothing instrumentals, with occasional singing. Certainly different, and certainly successful. A stepping stone that would take Eno from his earlier post-modern pop to his later full-on ambient albums. John Cale, Phil Collins and Robert Fripp are notable contributors.
