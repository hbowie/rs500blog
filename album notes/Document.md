Brian: 

Fun record I had not heard in a very long time. Interesting how these guys created a distinct sound from simple parts, paired with a political element that seemed to somehow stand out. Not the best R.E.M. record, so I expect a few more on this list. Track: tempted to pick “Disturbance At The Heron House”, but you have to respect “It’s The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)”. It’s a wonder why no one covers this song ;).


Charlie: 

Great record and some cool songs. Another artist I had never really listened to but I dug this album. Top two songs are “finest worksong” and “Fireplace.”


Body: 

This album sort of hits the sweet spot for me: interesting, literate, lyrics that are about the singer's relationship to the world around us, and not just about the singer and his or her fans; vocals that are listenable without being "pop"; muscular drums, bass and guitars all working in service of the song; and all of this built around a distinctive perspective. Many of the songs here express contradictory thoughts and feelings, but the classic "It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)" is the track that really encapsulates this into its chorus and song title, so that it's impossible to miss. This is the point where the liberation of the sixties meets the Reagan realities of the eighties head-on, and is the perfect rock head-heart-and-body anthem for the times.
