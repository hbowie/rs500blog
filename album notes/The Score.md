Brian: 

A great record. Listen to it while making dinner and sipping away at something. You will be swaying and grovein’. Cool song among many: “Zealots”, great samples with a great production over a rocksteady groove.


Charlie: 

It’s cool but I’m hoping for more of an eclectic collection of albums in the future…. there’s been a lot of rap. “the beast” wins top song but they’re all pretty cool. 


Body: 

Clever, literate lyrics, great vocals, a variety of sounds, humor, social conscience — this album pretty much has it all. An alternative (i.e. intelligent and literate) rap masterpiece. I love it that this album is made by a trio of kindred souls, and that it features a woman along with two men, and that they are clearly artistic equals working and playing together to express their thoughts and feelings about the world around them. It's refreshing to hear rap  and pop that is not self-centered, self-absorbed, and self-promoting, and to hear rap that allows men and women to have relationships based on the interplay of their minds rather than their bodies. My favorite cut is their rendition of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry".
