Brian: 

This is one I really intentionally listened to, having felt that maybe I negatively judged The Smiths in the past without ever sitting down and really listening to them. Afterall, I have had a lot of friends over the years who have loved them, and I have loved so many other things that Johnny Marr has been a part of. Some even consider The Smiths one of the most influential bands of the 1980’s. And certainly some of the lyrics are clever. But honestly, this album really did not change my mind, they just don’t really do it for me. Best track: “This Charming Man”, a song from it’s time.


Charlie: 

cool cool. He’s a great songwriter if you pay attention to the words (and if you can understand him) and I’ve never loved Morrisey’s voice but this is still a great album. Favorite song is “Miserable Lie.”


Body: 

An astonishing album. Lovely, jangling guitars, appealing music, strange vocals, lyrics examining topics found under stones others might consider best left unturned. Some sample words:  "And if you must, go to work, tomorrow / Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother / For there are brighter sides to life / And I should know, because I've seen them / but not very often." The song "Suffer Little Children" is written from the point of view of the ghosts of several children who were notoriously murdered on the moors outside of Manchester, and is the clear, haunting classic track from the album. I am often astonished at how guitars, drums, bass and vocals can be used in apparently endless variation to express seemingly every facet of the human condition, and this album is one more document submitted in support of that proposition.
