Brian: 

Such a great album, hard to understand how it is only at 392. An album of great range, yet held together as one somehow. Favorite track has to be “Get Back”, a song that may have been one of the first that really captured my imagination as a kid. 


Charlie: 

This should be higher but at least it's on here. One of my top Beatles albums. Can’t go wrong with any of these songs but I’ll choose “Two of Us”.


Body: 

There are a number of things I'd like to say about this album and its position on this list. 

First, its position sends a clear message about what it means to be in this part of the list vs. the higher positions. This is not a great album. Which means, I suppose, that we shouldn't take its peers in this block all that seriously. 

The Beatles were, from the beginning, nothing if not ambitious. And yet, this album not only drifts along without much ambition to be or do anything in particular, but explicitly seems to be *about* a lack of ambition: this is an album about looking backwards, or at most about stasis, about letting things be as they are, or as they were. It is the first Beatles album that is not about the future, not about being better than the past, not trying to move things farther ahead in some way. And so, appropriately, it was the last album they released as a unit. 

This lack of definite ambition manifested itself in a willingness to turn the final production over to Phil Spector, of all people. Now I love and respect Spector's work as much as the next person, but whatever he "added" to this album just needed to be taken off, like a bad paint job. Which is why the remaining Beatles, at some later point, released another version of this work, called *Let It Be Naked*. Spector's production technique is sometimes referred to as a "Wall of Sound," but his additions to this album really hearken back not at all to that early sound: instead we just get a lot of schmaltzy strings. 

With all this being said, the album contains some undeniably great singles: "Let It Be" and "Get Back." Which are enough, I guess, to earn the album a place on this list. 

In the end, though, this list would never have existed without The Beatles. Before The Beatles, no one dreamt of taking this sort of music seriously enough to talk about its musical quality, or to rank works such as these on their reputed merits.

And so, even if only for this reason, I suppose this album deserves to be included somewhere here.
