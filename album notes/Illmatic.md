Brian: 

Great album. Hangs together and tells of a life lived hard. Track pick ‘Life’s a Bitch’.


Charlie: 

Great rap album with some good funky beats. Although you can’t do better than “The World is Yours”, my pick is “Halftime”.  

Body: 

An influential rap masterpiece. Moody reflections about life on the streets.
