Brian: 

Took me awhile to find myself in the mindset for this album… and crushing my inbox at 9am was not quite what I had planned. But it was time to come back to this one. This band has one of the most apt names for its sound and meaning. Raw, powerful, tight, and a message packed in power rock/rap. Enjoyed this one. Track pick has to be ‘Killing In The Name’.

Charlie: 

Really dug this record. The band was locked. Not usually my cup of tea but it’s definitely a good record.


Body: 

This is really good stuff. Powerful, thoughtful music and lyrics. Favorite track was “Wake Up”: a nice number to program into your phone so this is the first thing you hear when your alarm goes off in the morning. (And oh, BTW, I just looked out my window and The Machine was still there, so maybe it’s time to spin this disc a few more times.)
