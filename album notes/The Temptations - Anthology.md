Another anthology that is no longer available, although there are plenty of others to choose from. However you package them, though, the classic tracks from The Temptations are about as good as you get. Vocals by turn gritty and silky, the best players in the business, production that is nothing less than perfect, emotive lyrics that tell timeless stories, poetic language â€” these things never get old.
