Brian: 

Could not find this album anywhere, but listened to a ton of The Temptations best ofs to get the gist. Really enjoyed it. Honestly it is easy to forget the range and ability of this revolving group of five male vocalists and dancers. They spanned an era which went from sappy Americana to some real soul. My track pick is the last track on the third LP of the 1995 version of ‘Anthology’ compilation: "Ball Of Confusion (That's What The World Is Today)". Kind of appropriate for the moment.


Charlie: 

You can’t go wrong with any of these songs. I was giving this a hard time cause I don’t really consider compilations the same as original albums, but with the Temptations, they were more of a singles based band which is something that I didn't really consider in the moment. All songs are stellar here. Familiar favorite- “Ain’t too proud to beg” and newer ones- “Cloud Nine” and “Beauty is only skin deep”.


Body: 

Another anthology that is no longer available, although there are plenty of others to choose from. However you package them, though, the classic tracks from The Temptations are about as good as you get. Vocals by turn gritty and silky, the best players in the business, production that is nothing less than perfect, emotive lyrics that tell timeless stories, poetic language — these things never get old.
