Brian: 

Great early punk record. Some really good tracks here. ‘Pink Flag’ stands out. 


Charlie: 

Wow. Honestly really enjoyed this record. Not great to do homework to but it’s fun. I can’t choose one cause they go by so fast! 

Body: 

Influential British punk debut from 1977. Twenty-one songs, mostly pretty short. Maybe it was my imagination, but the songs seemed to get more interesting on the second side. "Strange" was one of my favorite tracks, perhaps because it's one of the longest, and so doesn't have to start out at maximum volume.
