Brian: 

Really enjoyed it. So original in a way that is hard to pinpoint. Track pick, though I know it is a cover, ‘Take Me To The River”.


Charlie: 

Not my favorite; “Warning Sign”.


Body: 

“Take Me To The River” is pure magic. But of course it’s a cover of a song by Al Green. I find the rest of the album to be very listenable, and even likable at times, but I don’t think there are any other tracks here that rise to the level of greatness.
