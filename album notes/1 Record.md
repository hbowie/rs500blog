Brian: 

A good rock record from a band that should be much better known than they are. Their sound was an influence for many who came later. Track pick: “Thirteen”, a very sweet song. 


Charlie: 

What a great album. Too bad it never did anything commercially but every song on here is great. Favorite was “Ballad of El Goodo”.

Body: 

Definitely a great-sounding album. Nothing deep about the lyrics, but smoothly listenable, sounding a bit like The Beatles or The Byrds at times. Nice guitars, nice vocals. I think "Watch the Sunrise" was my favorite track.
