Brian: 

Love this record. Really did not know anything about this one, thoroughly enjoyed its bluesy, stewed rock. 


Body: 

Lots of interesting stuff going on here, and "Over Under Sideways Down" is just a classic, but the material here is not quite consistent enough for me to want to repeatedly listen to the entire album. Give it points, though, for actually naming the album after its recording engineer, Roger Cameron. Jeff Beck is the lead guitarist on this album, and he would move on from The Yardbirds to form his own group, with Rod Stewart and Ron Wood, and record a couple of albums that were a bit more consistent, to my mind.
