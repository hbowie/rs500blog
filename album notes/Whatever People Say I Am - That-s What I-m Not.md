Brian: 

One of those bands I have certainly heard but never really dug into. Solid effort, good musicians, but not really distinguishable despite being the fastest-selling debut album in British history. I am a big fan of Alex Turner’s solo work, but feel he is too covered up by the big sound and relentless pace of this album. Track pick: ‘Riot Van’ which in my view shows the potential of slowing down and telling a real story.


Charlie: 

Solid record… nice to hear where the Arctic Monkeys’ sound originated from. I feel like the record sounds older than 2006 in terms of that late 90s punk vibe and some of the songs are little eh... but overall good. My pick is “I Bet You Look Good On The Dancefloor”.


Body: 

I quite liked this. Thirteen songs in 41 minutes, so it's a lot of short songs that get in and get out while avoiding listener fatigue. At first listen, it may sound like a lot of artless thrashing, but the lead vocals, group vocals, guitar, drum and bass parts generally fit together quite neatly to achieve a lot of interesting, compelling effects. Not a lot of thematic depth, but neither is there much pretension here. Honest artistry, and music that feels alive and authentic. Good stuff. "A Certain Romance" would be my track pick.
