Brian: 

Just love this era of Roxy Music. Delicious glam rock. Brian Ferry at the top of his suave, charismatic, slightly over the edge persona. This is in some ways an uneven record, but I love it anyways, and there are some legendary tracks here, with “Do The Strand” as the clear stand out.


Charlie: 

This is a super cool album. Haven’t really listened to something like this before. Will def listen again though. My top pick is “strictly confidential“.


Body: 

Solid album, and a classic work of postmodernism, celebrating elaborate posturing, smooth façades, and the impermanence of everything except pop iconography. This was the last album that could completely contain the ambitions of both Bryan Ferry and Brian Eno, and it's a stronger work because of it.
