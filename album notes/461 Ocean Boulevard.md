Brian: 

A fun, yet somehow not exceptional record from an era of bluesy rock. “Motherless Children” stands out, but my track pick is “Mainline Florida” as it seems so much of the era. 

Charlie: 

This is a classic record and it sounds great. They’re all kinda the same groove which I usually don’t like, but the musicianship is great and it sounds like they’re having a fun time recording. “Motherless Children” is my top.

Body: 

Clapton's first decade in recorded music established his identity as one of the preeminent guitarists of his generation, and a versatile contributor to a series of bands that were all groundbreaking in their own ways: John Mayall and the Blues Breakers, The Yardbirds, Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos. When Clapton decided to pursue a solo career, though, he seemed to become a man of much more modest ambitions. And so it is with this, his second studio album. It's a tremendously comfortable collection of rootsy tracks, without a false step anywhere, but there's nothing here that breaks any new ground, or that attempts to say anything that hasn't been well said before. "Motherless Children" is my favorite track. Compare it to Steve Miller's version for a really different feel.
