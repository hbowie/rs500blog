Brian: 

A lot to listen to. Some excellent songs, but this record seems indulgent and could have used a strong producer who had the ability to pare it down to the best ten or twelve tracks. That is surprising for an artist who was known as "the quiet Beatle", but this triple album really wanders around at times. Best song for me has to be “My Sweet Lord”, a classic.


Charlie: 

“All Things Must Pass” the song itself is one of my favorite songs of all time. Great album and one of my fav post beatle albums. Too bad he ripped off “My Sweet Lord” or he’d have even more success from the album. 


Body: 

When this triple album was first released in 1970, shortly after the breakup of The Beatles, we all thought "Good for you, George!" and dutifully tried to listen to the entire thing, usually while smoking a joint or two. But despite the all-star cast, and a decent supply of good material, this is an album that ultimately ends up being less than the sum of its parts. Part of the problem, I think, is George's voice. It's neither good enough nor bad enough to make much of an impression on the listener, and sounds pretty much the same on every track, which may be the main reason why the rest of The Beatles used to limit his contributions to one or two songs per album.
