When this triple album was first released in 1970, shortly after the breakup of The Beatles, we all thought "Good for you, George!" and dutifully tried to listen to the entire thing, usually while smoking a joint or two. But despite the all-star cast, and a decent supply of good material, this is an album that ultimately ends up being less than the sum of its parts. Part of the problem, I think, is George's voice. It's neither good enough nor bad enough to make much of an impression on the listener, and sounds pretty much the same on every track, which may be the main reason why the rest of The Beatles used to limit his contributions to one or two songs per album.
