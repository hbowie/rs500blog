This album almost seems like a response to #445, Steve Miller's *Fly Like an Eagle* released just one year earlier. This edgy, hypnotic synth-punk album includes the terrifying tale of "Frankie Teardrop" who, contrary to Miller's injunction, simply sinks like a stone. Certainly very original and influential and worth a listen, even if none of these tunes end up on your regular playlist.
