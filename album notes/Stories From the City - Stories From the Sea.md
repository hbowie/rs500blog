Body: 

A mesmerizing collection of tracks. Songs of real depth and character. Powerful but not overwhelming instrumentation. Words and vocals are front and center, thankfully. Lyrics are penetrating, rather than being random and catchy. Vocals are consistently revealing without being melodramatic or flashy. This album was a well-deserved winner of the Mercury Prize for best UK album of the year. A cohesive, seductive work attempting to reconcile very personal feelings of love and lust with an outward awareness of danger and injustice. Certainly merits repeated listening.
