Brian: 

I would put Dr. John in the category of artists that I appreciate are good, and for which I understand that many people love his music. I also understand he represented an important genre and sub-culture of American music. As such, I am not going to argue he does not deserve his place on this list, but he just does not do much for me. He seems to never escape a caricature here. Track pick: “Tipitina”, perhaps the most gritty of the tracks here where his piano playing really shines through.


Charlie: 

Love this album. So much fun and some of the drum parts are actually really cool. I can’t choose just one song, they’re all great. If you wanna be put in a good mood, listen to this album. 


Body: 

Well, if that don't beat all. I like Dr. John a lot — and mourned his passing in 2019. And I love the style of New Orleans R&B that he celebrates on this album. And I find this album listenable and enjoyable. But I'm just not convinced it's one of the top 500 albums of all time. I'm sure it was influential at the time, introducing a lot of young listeners to the music of such greats as Professor Longhair, but there are versions of these classics that I like better, and there are other, more original Dr. John albums that I enjoy more — such as "N'Awlinz: Dis Dat or d'Udda".
