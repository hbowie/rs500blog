Awesome album. Love them all to be honest. My LEAST favorite song is “Fly like an eagle” ironically. But top 3 are “Wild mountain honey” “rock'n me” and “dance, dance, dance”


Body: 

It was this album, Steve Miller's ninth, that provided the firm foundation to the long and productive performing career that followed. I saw him in concert just this summer, for perhaps the fourth time in forty-five years, and he's still performing about half of the tracks that appeared on this album, many of which were hits for him when the album was first released. It's not a deep or complex or challenging collection, but there's a reason why this music has proven so durable: it's honest and sincere, it's warm and egalitarian and a bit utopian, it's relaxed but still rhythmic, and every track was clearly made by a master craftsman at the top of his form. There's not really a bad cut on here, and the album is definitely worth listening to from front to back as one cohesive whole.
