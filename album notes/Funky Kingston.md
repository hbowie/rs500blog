Brian: 

Such a great record. Rich, deep, soupy and full of spirit across a range of influences. Track pick: I absolutely love their rendition of John Denver’s ‘Country Road’, but I am going to pick ‘Funky Kingston’.


Charlie: 

Now that’s what I’m talkin about. “Louie Louie” is my fav, but the whole record is great musicianship. 


Body: 

I was surprised at the breadth of musical influences evident in the recording, especially American soul. There are times when Toots sounds like Otis Redding, and others when he sounds like Ray Charles. I was also surprised with the breadth of instrumentation: every track has a very full sound. My track pick would have to be “Time Tough” which seems as relevant in America today as it must have been in Jamaica when this song was first written and recorded.
