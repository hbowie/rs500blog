Brian: 

I love this record. Listened to it a lot when it first came out, and it remains very good. Exceptionally good song writing with an intimacy of a long walk alone. Track pick: “Million Miles”


Charlie: 

This is one of the greatest records I’ve ever heard. Wow. Amazing listen. “Standing in the doorway” is my favorite but man- you can't go wrong with any of these. Seriously. 

Body: 

An interesting late effort from Dylan. This is Dylan's 30th studio album, and if you think there's some way you can record this many albums that live up to the standards set by his first few, you'd be crazy. Dylan reportedly wrote this batch of songs while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch, and if you're guessing that these surroundings wouldn't exactly result in an upbeat party album, you'd be correct. Daniel Lanois produced this double album, and used a slew of different musicians in the studio. This reportedly led to a certain degree of chaos during the recording sessions, but Dylan often did his best work in similar conditions, and the results hold up well. This is an album about growing old and losing faith, and losing love, and what it feels like to perhaps outlive your best self and your best days, and still have to get up every day and look yourself in the mirror. As such, it's an honest and important document from a worthy winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. File this away under "Albums to Listen To When You Get Old and Are Thinking It Couldn't Get Any Worse".
