Brian: 

Really enjoyed this record. A whole album of Waits is like a journey down the hole of psychological gravitas and muck. This album reflects a time Waits lived in a basement apartment in Manhattan before it cleaned up. Track pick: “Jockey Full of Bourbon”


Charlie: 

This has similar experimental elements to “Time out of MInd” with other elements mixed in (which makes sense since he was heavily influenced by Dylan). “Time” is my pick. 


Body: 

While I was playing this album, Pauline asked me "What are you listening to: the soundtrack to a horror film?" And she was right on the money in a couple of respects. First, the overall album has the feel of a soundtrack, in terms of the quantity of music, the variety of presentation and tone, and its atmospheric aspect -- much of the album seems like it is meant to be backdrop for some foreground action that is only alluded to, as opposed to a series of self-contained stories. And then the vocals and much of the instrumentation are meant to be jarring, to put you on edge: easy grooving music it is not. But with all that being said, the instrumentation is as full and sharp and varied as you might want for a Tom Waits album, the songs are plentiful and top-notch, and the overall thematic texture is about as *noir* as a Waits fan could hope for. I think it's pegged about right at # 399.
