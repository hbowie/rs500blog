Brian: 

What a great, innovative, and very listenable record. Entertaining at every turn, with humor and charm. Hard to avoid the track pick of ‘Ms. Jackson’, which has a great backstory I heard on NPR’s Sound Opinions some time back.  


Charlie: 

Fun album. While this one has the hits, I like Aquemini better. “Gasoline Dreams” is my favorite on the album. 


Body: 

A sprawling masterpiece. A variety of musical styles and a variety of moods. Endlessly inventive and extremely listenable.
