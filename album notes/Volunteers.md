Brian: 

Have to admit I had never listened to a whole Jefferson Airplane album. Enjoyed it, though got a bit tedious. An uneven record in my opinion. Track pick: ‘Wooden Ships’


Charlie: 

Another really good album. Has some good melodies and good jam moments. Overall solid record. “Good Shepherd” is my pick.

Body: 

I've always liked this album, and still enjoy it.  I’ve written more extensively about “We Can Be Together” at [Reason to Rock](https://www.reasontorock.com/tracks/we_can_be_together.html). So many different voices, so many modes of expression. These are the sounds of a band trying to hold itself together while the various members were starting to head off in different directions, resulting in lots of variety. It's a bit ironic that the British sessionman player Nicky Hopkins provides the most unifying element for the album, with his nimble fingers tickling the ivories on almost every track. I keep thinking that some of these songs must be throw-aways, but every time I listen I find something to appreciate about each one of them. "Good Shepherd" has always been a favorite of mine, and guitarist Jorma Kaukonen is still performing this one pretty much to this day.
