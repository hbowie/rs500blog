Brian: 

I think it is fair to say that my musical tastes matured in direct opposition to KISS. Listening to this album was like eating lukewarm lutefisk standing in high heel boots at a hard rock picnic in rural Minnesota while swarmed by black flies and mosquitoes. I know I have to do it, and look like I am enjoying it, but really I just want to spit it out in the bushes (along with the fake blood and empty mascara containers). If I have to pick: “Rock And Roll Party” because it was the last and shortest song and here KISS did not attempt to sing or play actual instruments. Thank goodness.


Charlie: 

If B thinks ZZ Top is gimmicky, then this is my ZZ Top. These guys to me are a gimmick and I’ve never been into Kiss ever. Don’t really like this album. It’s what I expect it to sound like and even more cheezy than that. If I hear Beth again, I don’t know if I will be able to stand it. Sorry. Listen to “Sweet Pain”... that should give you an idea of the more “enjoyable” side of the album. 


Body: 

If you grew up listening to this stuff, then I guess I can see how it might get under your skin, but such was not my fate. It’s well done, considering what it is, but it’s not much.
