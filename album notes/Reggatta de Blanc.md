Brian: 

This is peak The Police and why I loved them for a time. Strong songs, with depth and hooks. Favorite track is definitely ‘Walking On The Moon’.


Charlie: 

Great record; classic. Way better than ‘Synchronicity’. Pretty much all songs on here are good but I’ll go with “It’s Alright For You”.


Body: 

Solid album with a couple of great tracks. "Message in a Bottle" is still compelling 40 years later, after countless listens. "On Any Other Day" is a lot of fun, and notable for its wombat reference.
