Brian: 

Super fun pre-post-punk. Ironic and fun and great musicians. Track: “#1 Hit Song” of course! 

Charlie: 

This is a super cool record. Anyone without a well listened ear would hate this but I think this is a cool record. Need to listen to again to fully grasp it. 

Body: 

Another great one. The album contains 43 songs, but none of them are longer than two minutes, and they're all interesting and adventurous, without being alienating. Their attitude is certainly punk — in the sense that these guys call into question all the easy assumptions of mainstream America — but the trio's musicianship is interesting and solid, without resorting to over-the-top screaming and distortion and inane shouting. Glad it made the list.
