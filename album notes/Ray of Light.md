Brian: 

I approached this album with trepidation. Skipping it many times but knowing I had to come back to it and listen to it. I decided to do my best to think of this as an album from an artist I had never heard of and to try to forget my preconceived biases. My conclusion? It’s not awful, but neither is it great. She clearly surrounded herself with good musicians and production, and I guess she has to be commended for exploring electronica, but the songs lack anything memorable and it is hard to see this album this high on the list without putting it down to the power of celebrity and sales. Track pick: ‘Ray of Light’.


Charlie: 

The first few songs are really good. The rest didn’t blow my mind but not a bad album. This album is here cause of how it used electronica in mainstream pop which wasn’t done much before this and also it’s got a few good singles. Not my favorite but definitely not my least favorite either. The first song is my pick (really dug it).


Body: 

A sweet-tasting bit of pop fluff. Professionally done, with showcase vocals on some of the tracks, but I never found any of it very convincing or compelling. Tasty in small bits, but nothing to stick to these ribs. Repetitive at times, in a way that is probably meant to be hypnotic, but it’s just… not.
