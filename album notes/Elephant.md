Brian: 

Simply a great album. Raw, full, balanced, well-crafted emotional songs. My pick from this album is “Seven Nation Army”. A first song that announces the emotion and energy of this album to perfection.


Charlie: 

Have loved this record since I was a kid. Very inspirational for me and I'm still impressed how much sound two people can cover. “I Just Don’t Know What To Do With Myself” is great.


Body: 

Pretty irresistible. Nifty songs, nice vocals, raw-sounding, with a nice balance of careful composition and unleashed guitar. Well placed on this list.
