Brian: 

This is a great album, and very influential when it came out. Now it seems a bit tame, but very easy to listen to. Favorite track is “Five Man Army”.


Charlie: 

This album is so good. Really dig it. Drum sounds are really good. “Five Man Army” and “Safe from Harm” are my picks.


Body: 

I liked it. Far enough out but not too far. Good songs, good vocals, and good sounds. I found the closing track, "Hymn of The Big Wheel," to be absolutely haunting. "The big wheel keeps on turning / On a simple line day by day / The earth spins on its axis / One man struggle while another relaxes."  But the whole song is great. Very touching, and couldn’t be more relevant today.
