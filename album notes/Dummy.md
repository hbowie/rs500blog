Brian: 

A truly exceptional album. Beautiful and mysterious. Original and yet accessible. Certainly deserving of a higher placement on this list. “Glory Box” is a gem. 

Charlie: 

Very cool and experimental record. I like the different sounds and beats used here. Top track is “Roads”.


Body: 

An enchanting, otherworldly album. Apparently a pioneering work in the short-lived trip-hop movement. The lyrics and vocals from Beth Gibbons are generally slow and tortured, as if it were a trial to wrest each sinuous syllable from her lips. The music often feels like the soundtrack for a film in which mysterious characters are on the verge of doing unspeakable things to one another. Extremely listenable.
