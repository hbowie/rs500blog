Brian: 

A phenomenal album. Though their sound borrowed from The Velvet Underground, they brought a modern spin. Favorite track, ‘Old World’.


Charlie: 

Not really a fan; tried to listen a second time and still didn’t do it for me but I’m sure this is many people’s cup of tea.


Body: 

A truly great album. Jonathan Richman has always had a sort of radical innocence about him that I find appealing (something the Farrelly brothers employed to great effect when featuring him in the film *There's Something About Mary*). Richman was certainly influenced by The Velvet Underground, and The Modern Lovers in turn influenced The Sex Pistols, but in some important ways putting this group in the same basket with these other bands is misleading, because The Modern Lovers lack the decadence or jaded cynicism that we associate with these other acts. To the contrary, Richman and his compatriots are at the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to alienation. (Where The Who were singing "Hope I die before I get old," The Modern Lovers sang "Someday I'll be dignified and old.") Where this album did exert an influence was in its emphasis on short, simple songs, making it clear that four guys with a love of rock and roll could succeed, not by becoming increasingly more sophisticated, but by embracing and retaining the primal constraints of simple chords, simple instrumentation, simple words, simple thoughts and simple singing. Much as the Elizabethans did with the sonnet form, The Modern Lovers demonstrated that these constraints were not impediments to their artistic ambitions, but simply formed a ready vessel into which they could pour their thoughts and feelings. Utterly unique and timeless.
