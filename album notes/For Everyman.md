I love this record. Knew a few of the songs on it beforehand and I like browne’s writing a lot. Great record.

Body: 

While this may not be a perfect album, it is awfully damned good, and probably deserves a higher ranking on this list. Accompaniment includes David Crosby, Glenn Frey, Don Henley and Bonnie Raitt providing vocals, Jim Keltner and Russ Kunkel on drums, Sneaky Pete on pedal steel, David Lindley on a whole roomful of stringed instruments, Joni Mitchell and Elton John on piano, Spooner Oldham and Bill Payne on keyboards, Leland Skar on bass — and I'm probably overlooking a few luminaries, even at that. But even without all the name-dropping, it's easy to hear that the vocals and instrumentation are nothing short of sublime. And while you could call the song collection a bit uneven — a few tracks are only very good, and not great — it seems a bit niggling to subtract so many points for that. The title song was written as a response to the song "Wooden Ships," and listening attentively to both songs will provide you with a world of context about what was going on in the early seventies. That title song, along with "Take It Easy," "I Thought I Was a Child," "These Days" and "Red Neck Friend" are among the indisputably great cuts on the album.
