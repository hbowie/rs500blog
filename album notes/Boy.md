To me, this album sounds full of promise, but a promise not yet realized. There seems to be a mismatch between the introspective nature of the lyrics on the one hand, exploring with some sensitivity the border between boyhood and manhood, and the full-throated, galloping, relentless, grab-you-by-the-throat-and-don't-let go anthemic delivery on the other. I'm not convinced this album belongs on this list but, hey, if U2's your band, then you'll probably find something to love here.
