Brian: 

This project affords if not requires us to put on the hat of the critic. It is in that spirit that I hereby deem this album the most self indulgent of the albums we have heard thus far. In this record U2 elevates everything to arena anthem levels, begging us to pull out our lighters and belt out these songs. It has always smacked me as self-indulgent in a way. Queen of course, and others, have done the same. But U2 asks us to crawl down the alleys of despair and youth as we rock out in a way that just feels especially self indulgent to me. So this record is perhaps peak self-indulgence by the most self-indulgent band in the world. But, it is quite good as well. Track pick, “Stories for Boys”.


Charlie: 

it’s alright but gets repetitive. Cool vibe; just a lot of the same.

Body: 

To me, this album sounds full of promise, but a promise not yet realized. There seems to be a mismatch between the introspective nature of the lyrics on the one hand, exploring with some sensitivity the border between boyhood and manhood, and the full-throated, galloping, relentless, grab-you-by-the-throat-and-don't-let go anthemic delivery on the other. I'm not convinced this album belongs on this list but, hey, if U2's your band, then you'll probably find something to love here.
