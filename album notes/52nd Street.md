Brian: 

Another artist it is fun to not like for some reason, but I need to stand up to that here even if some of the songs are a little insufferable, honestly (“Honesty”, see what I did there?) . This is a good album of its time. Track pick: “My Life”, a song made for driving around with the top down.


Charlie: 

Never liked Billy Joel but I guess I never gave him a chance. Really dug this record. Great songs and great players. “Honesty” is my favorite. 

Body: 

One of Joel's best albums. Lots of NYC attitude, strong tunes, a variety of styles, good production, and great accompaniment from the likes of jazz great Freddie Hubbard.
