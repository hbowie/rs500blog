Brian: 

Listened to YHF a ton when it came out and still really like it, though it seems to have lost a touch of polish for me. A complete work, the songs all of a sort. My fav here: “Poor Places”, because I love how they pull in the audio loop at the end. 


Charlie: 

I know their album Wilco and didn’t love it at first listen but this album makes me wanna give it a second chance. Great concept and experimental album. Love it. First song is probably my favorite cause the drum part is super cool, but whole album is cool. Glad it’s there. 


Body: 

Very cohesive album. Hangs together as a single work. Sounds a bit rough and polished at the same time -- well crafted to sound perfectly imperfect, if that makes any sense. Can see why their original record company passed on it, and can see why it was successful anyway. Definitely sounded like they were channeling The Kinks at times. Especially liked “Heavy Metal Drummer” and “I’m the Man Who Loves You.” There’s a thin line between being so alternative that no one wants to listen to you vs. being so mainstream that you’re clearly just going for the hits, and Wilco seems to walk that line perfectly on this effort.
