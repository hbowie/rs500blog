Brian: 

Really enjoyed this one. Was not familiar with TLC, really. Another artist I missed in my crazy busy early 90’s. This album lives up to its title. Nearly picked ‘Sexy-Interlude; as my favorite track as it seriously made me laugh out loud, but going with ‘Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes’.


Charlie: 

Cool record. I try not to choose songs I already know off the album as my favorite but you can’t deny “Waterfalls” (well, paul mccartney could’ve). 


Body: 

This thing exceeded my expectations. Much of the content lives up to the promise of the album's title and cover photo, with very listenable and somewhat predictable lyrics and music, but there's some other stuff here to fill the album out thematically, and overall I liked it. My favorite track was "Sumthin' Wicked This Way Comes."
