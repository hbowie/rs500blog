This is the American version of the band's debut album, and is hard to find. Which is a shame, because it includes the band's first three singles, which did not make it onto their British debut album, released the year before, and titled 'Three Imaginary Boys.' The music is bright and inventive and powerful with drums, bass and guitar all more than pulling their weight. The lyrics, though, especially on the more widely available UK release, are pretty uniformly simplistic and dark. 'Killing an Arab' is the title of one of those first three singles, and is a reference to French existentialist Albert Camus' novel 'The Stranger'. While the title should not be taken literally, the reference can still be used as a gauge for the sort of meaningless void you'll find yourself in while listening to most of these songs.
