Brian: 

Very original and of lasting quality, this is a great record. A cross cultural landscape of sounds and attitudes, and bounces you along, entertained through some serious subjects. So many great tracks on this album, but I am going with “Paper Planes”, such a well crafted song.


Charlie: 

Another fun album that I didn’t expect to like. This project is great not only cause it exposes your mind to new albums, but new artists/genres. I wouldn’t listen to most of these on my own time so I’m glad this project is happening. “Bird Flu” is my top track.


Body: 

A fun cultural and musical mashup. I liked “Bamboo Banga” the best. Someone called this album “vigorous,” and that’s as good a description as any.
