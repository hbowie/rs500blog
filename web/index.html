<title>Blogging the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time</title>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>“C” is a drummer with an idea. Listen to Rolling Stone Magazine’s 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time before he graduates high school in the spring of 2020.</p>
<p>“B” is his uncle and thought, “Hmmm, sounds interesting, maybe I should listen to those too.”</p>
<p>“H” is somehow related to both “C” and “B” but none of us can work out exactly how. “H” loves music and knows the early stuff. He wanted in.</p>
<p>“C” was born in the 2000’s. “B” was born in the 1960’s. “H” was born in the 1950’s.</p>
<p>We decided to record our thoughts and notes on the albums as we go along. Most of these are jots and hot-takes, and a way to record the process. We will not always agree, but that’s kinda the point.</p>
<p>We have a lot to get through, so keep up.</p>
<hr />
<p>About the RS 500.</p>
<p>The RS 500 was assembled by the editors of Rolling Stone, based on the results of two extensive polls. In 2003, Rolling Stone asked a panel of 271 artists, producers, industry executives and journalists to pick the greatest albums of all time. In 2009, they asked a similar group of 100 experts to pick the best albums of the 2000s. From those results, Rolling Stone created this new list of the greatest albums of all time.</p>

<p>We know this is biased to Western Culture, and we will not necessarily agree with all these even being on the list. But hey, it is a list. Let’s get spinnin’ and streamin’….</p>

<h2>She's So Unusual</h2>

<p><em>Portrait, 1983</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Listening to this reminded me of one of those dates you went on when you were young. She’s cute, and fun, but after ten minutes of trying to seem into her all you can think of is how are you going to get out of here. “She Bop” is actually the best song on this record, even if it was not the hit that “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” and “Time after Time” were. </p>

<p>C, 2002: lotta hits on here… lotta hits. Again, not an 80s fan but I definitely appreciate the music. I should’ve written that for the other ones I didn’t like… so read it now: I APPRECIATE THE MUSIC AND RESPECT IT EVEN IF I DON’T LIKE THE ALBUM. Good record any song on here will give you the vibe of it. Which in my opinion isn’t a great thing, but hey that’s my opinion. There are plenty of people who love this stuff. That’s why it was famous and is on the top 500. </p>

<p>H, 1951: The production and instrumentation sound a bit dated today, but there are several things about this album that I just love: the cover photo by Annie Liebovitz, taken at Coney Island; the title of the album; and Lauper’s girlish, saucy vocals. And then there are “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” and “Time After Time.” These just strike me as absolutely classic tracks that still stand out as unique and powerful artistic expressions. My favorite lines: “Some boys take a beautiful girl / And hide her away from the rest of the world / I want to be the one to walk in the sun.” Yes indeed. Walk on, girl. </p>

<h2>New Day Rising</h2>

<p><em>SST, 1985</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Punk meets American Music Club? You can definitely hear early Nirvana and the influence on grunge in here, and thus the influence they had on rock overall. Track pick: “Perfect Example” since it seem to indicate more of what would follow than the rest of the album to me. </p>

<p>C, 2002: I hear early nirvana here and honestly that&#146;s all I could hear… the audio quality of this record is bad. Kinda ruined it for me and I was using a quality speaker… no top song for me but I didn’t hate the album. But this and Kiss back to back is a lot in your face unless you’re into that sorta thing. </p>

<p>H, 1951: I liked this: energetic, straight-ahead drums, guitar, bass and vocals, nothing longer than four minutes; nice punk sound and attitude, without straining to permanently shred anyone’s eardrums or go over the top to offend anyone. A nice variety of compact songs, each of which succeeds on its own terms. “Books About UFOs” is actually bouncy and cheerful. Here’s my favorite couplet from the album: “There&#146;s more to life than being right and wrong / There&#146;s something in between called getting along.” “How To Skin A Cat” is pleasantly reminiscent of Frank Zappa. </p>

<h2>Destroyer</h2>

<p><em>Casablanca, 1976</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: I think it is fair to say that my musical tastes matured in direct opposition to KISS. Listening to this album was like eating lukewarm lutefisk standing in high heel boots at a hard rock picnic in rural Minnesota while swarmed by black flies and mosquitoes. I know I have to do it, and look like I am enjoying it, but really I just want to spit it out in the bushes (along with the fake blood and empty mascara containers). If I have to pick: “Rock And Roll Party” because it was the last and shortest song and here KISS did not attempt to sing or play actual instruments. Thank goodness. </p>

<p>C, 2002: If B thinks ZZ Top is gimmicky, then this is my ZZ Top. These guys to me are a gimmick and I’ve never been into Kiss ever. Don’t really like this album. It’s what I expect it to sound like and even more cheezy than that. If I hear Beth again, I don’t know if I will be able to stand it. Sorry. Listen to “Sweet Pain”... that should give you an idea of the more “enjoyable” side of the album. </p>

<p>H, 1951: If you grew up listening to this stuff, then I guess I can see how it might get under your skin, but such was not my fate. It’s well done, considering what it is, but it’s not much. </p>

<h2>Tres Hombres</h2>

<p><em>London, 1973</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: I always looked at these guys as a bit of a gimmick, probably because of MTV over cooking a sexy soufle of “Sharp Dressed Man” with Robert Palmer and Madonna videos. But this is a good record. “La Grange” is honestly a lot of fun. </p>

<p>C, 2002: Great album. Classic. Can’t go wrong with “Jesus Just left Chicago”. Not too much to say besides if you haven’t listened to it yet, give it a listen. It’s good. </p>

<p>H, 1951: If sophistication of any kind is the disease, then I guess this album must be the cure. Believe me, I like the blues, and I like lots of music from Texas, and I like John Lee Hooker, and this stuff is listenable, but I just don’t understand how it can be rated the top anything of all time. I’ll willingly admit that this album distills Texas bar band blues-rock to its bare essentials and perfects those, but then I’m still not sure what you’ve got. </p>

<h2>Born Under a Bad Sign</h2>

<p><em>Stax, 1967</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Good blues record. More meat on the bone. My pick: “Kansas City”. </p>

<p>C, 2002: What B said. </p>

<p>H, 1951: Good mix of Albert King’s stinging guitar runs with the legendary Stax/Volt house band, resulting in as much rhythm as blues. Good bunch of fresh songs, including some written by the Stax/Volt regulars specifically for King. “Born Under a Bad Sign” became a signature song for Cream as well as King. It’s a great example of the fertile cross-pollination that was happening at this point in musical history. Albert King, a bluesman, signed with Stax, a Memphis soul label, and then began recording with their house band. Two of the Stax regulars, singer Albert Bell and keyboards player Booker T. Jones, penned this song specifically for King, inspired by the interest in astrology that was popular at the time. Stax was distributed by Atlantic records, run by Ahmet Ertegun, and the label requested that Cream record the song. The album includes a couple of interesting misfires as well, with King trying to croon his way through “I Almost Lost My MInd” and “The Very Thought of You.” </p>

<h2>Touch</h2>

<p><em>RCA, 1984</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: I was not a huge fan of Annie Lennox and Eurythmics back in the day, but I know they are super talented. So I listened to this with extra intention. But in the end, came away feeling the same way. Well executed record, and a definite sound, but not one I can love. Most interesting song to me is actually the one after “Here Comes the Rain Again”, I think “Regrets” is better even if it was not the hit. </p>

<p>C, 2002: I’m not a big 80s fan but this album was pretty decent. Didn’t hate it. I listened to it while writing an essay so I already wasn’t even keen on it. May give it a second chance down the line but nothing jumped at me. </p>

<p>H, 1951: Annie Lennox’s silky, sensual vocals combined with Dave Stewart’s bouncy, cool, instrumentation… it’s like salt and pepper, sweet and sour, syrup and pancakes… well, you get the idea. Close to irresistible listening, even if there’s not necessarily a lot of original thematic substance here. But there’s not a clinker on the album (so long as you don’t stray into the “bonus” tracks on the “Deluxe” Edition). </p>

<h2>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</h2>

<p><em>Nonesuch, 2002</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Listened to YHF a ton when it came out and still really like it, though it seems to have lost a touch of polish for me. A complete work, the songs all of a sort. My fav here: “Poor Places”, because I love how they pull in the audio loop at the end. </p>

<p>C, 2002: I know their album Wilco and didn’t love it at first listen but this album makes me wanna give it a second chance. Great concept and experimental album. Love it. First song is probably my favorite cause the drum part is super cool, but whole album is cool. Glad it’s there. </p>

<p>H, 1951: Very cohesive album. Hangs together as a single work. Sounds a bit rough and polished at the same time &#8212; well crafted to sound perfectly imperfect, if that makes any sense. Can see why their original record company passed on it, and can see why it was successful anyway. Definitely sounded like they were channeling The Kinks at times. Especially liked “Heavy Metal Drummer” and “I’m the Man Who Loves You.” There’s a thin line between being so alternative that no one wants to listen to you vs. being so mainstream that you’re clearly just going for the hits, and Wilco seems to walk that line perfectly on this effort. </p>

<h2>Oracular Spectacular</h2>

<p><em>Columbia, 2008</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Loved this record. Some songs on here that I heard before and liked and never knew were MGMT. I suspect when this came out it really sounded fresh, but it still holds up. “Electric Feel” is a great song, but many to pick from here. </p>

<p>C, 2002: Always have loved it and still do. Record still holds and still to me seems like something there’s not too much of. That could be totally wrong but this is an album that of that type of stuff I love. “The Youth” is great as is “Kids” and “Time To Pretend”. But can’t go wrong with any of them. </p>

<p>H, 1951: Good album. Solid songs. A bit overproduced for my tastes, but still a great variety of interesting sounds. Interesting lyrics often sung with tongues firmly in cheeks. “Time to Pretend” is probably my favorite. </p>

<h2>Give It Up</h2>

<p><em>Warner Bros., 1972</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Was looking forward to this one, but it really left me wanting. Just sounded a bit flat and a bit like a rote blues record without depth. My pick: “You Told Me Baby”, but honestly nothing really stood out. </p>

<p>C, 2002: I enjoyed it! Good record and Bonnie sounds great on it. Good band and good vibes from it. A solid record… may not be a standout but definitely wasn’t a deal breaker. </p>

<p>H, 1951: A fantastic album. A wonderful supporting cast of musicians. A tasteful mix of blues, dixieland, and contemporary songcraft, including the classic “Under the Falling Sky” by Jackson Browne. Great guitar work by Bonnie and others. But Bonnie’s vocals are the highlight. She’s one of very few interpreters I know who can handle such a broad range of material and thoroughly own each song, not just using her voice to express the songwriter’s intentions, but instead using the compositions to express different facets of her own authentic self. Every track is worthwhile, and each has a unique feel. The album ends with what is, for my money, the definitive rendition of “Love Has No Pride.” I recently read a comment made by one author on another’s work, saying “You can’t write any better without showing off,” and this is a fitting tribute to Raitt on this transcendent cut: you really can’t sing any better than this without showing off. </p>

<h2>Boz Scaggs</h2>

<p><em>Atlantic, 1969</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: More like Bozzzzz Scaggzzzzzzz. Good for a nap. Not must to see here, move along. If I have to pick: “Loan Me A Dime”. </p>

<p>C, 2002: I love that it’s the muscle shoals rhythm section but just a little too much 6/8 for me. Always down for “I’m Easy” though. </p>

<p>H, 1951: I’ve owned this album ever since it was first released. It was recorded with the legendary backing musicians at Muscle Shoals, plus Duane Allman, guitarist with the Allman Brothers who also played with Derek and the Dominos on <em>Layla</em>. I like the way Scaggs draws on his musical roots here, blending them seamlessly with his own voice and compositions and musical sensibility. I enjoy listening to every song on this album, but the one real standout is “Loan Me a Dime.” It’s a slow burner that stretches to almost thirteen minutes. That length sounds self-indulgent, but the horns, piano, organ, vocals and guitar all work together perfectly and build relentlessly, creating and sustaining a haunting, haunted atmosphere. Duane Allman is in perfect command of his instrument and the material, never simply flaunting his prowess, but continually adding new brush strokes to the track as it unfolds. The fade-out at the end is perfect, leaving the listener with the impression that there’s no way out for the singer, that he’s still out there somewhere, looking for that dime, trying to connect with his old-time used-to-be. </p>

<h2>White Blood Cells</h2>

<p><em>Sympathy for the Record Industry, 2001</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Phenomenal record with rock talent and passion oozing out. My pick: “We’re Going To Be Friends”. I know it is sappy as hell, and not really indicative of the record, but it is just so cute and happy. I added it to my morning playlist. </p>

<p>C, 2002: I knew this record already from hearing it when I was a kid but it’s still great. It’s crazy how much sound can be covered by two musicians and have it not sound cheesy or like it’s missing something. Favorite song off of it is probably either “Hotel Yorba” or “Now Mary”. </p>

<p>H, 1951: Hadn’t heard this before, but enjoyed listening to it, and might even listen to it again. Lots of short songs, interesting, sometimes deceptively simple lyrics, often from the perspective of a male with one foot still in childhood, and one foot tentatively testing the waters of what it might mean to be an adult. The songs are a bit sketch-like, both in terms of lyrics and music, seemingly tossed off casually rather than being fully developed, but that is part of the album’s appeal. Hard to resist the charm of “We’re going to be friends,” which is so simple but so convincing a picture of what it’s like to be a kid happy to have a friend you can walk to school with. The whole thing reminds me a bit of Jonathan Richman. </p>

<h2>The Stone Roses</h2>

<p><em>Silvertone, 1989</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Have always loved this record. Dynamic, big guitars put on rails of bass and drums. Awesome stuff, and you can hear just how influential this record was still today. So many great songs, but “Fools Gold” is just so good. </p>

<p>C, 2002: First time ever hearing of this band but the album is super cool. I’d definitely listen again. Not a huge fan of bye bye bad man but the album as a whole is great. Definitely glad I came across this one. </p>

<p>H, 1951: A phrase comes to mind that I’m likely to use a lot during this exercise: “surprisingly listenable.” Which means that I’d never heard it before, listened to it once for this effort, understood its appeal, but found no good reason to ever hear it again. </p>
<hr />

<p>#499</p>

<h2>Live in Cook County Jail</h2>

<p><em>ABC, 1971</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Really wanted to love this one, but honestly I just could not get into it. Found it a bit tedious. My pick: “The Thrill is Gone”, but that’s about it. </p>

<p>C, 2002: Good album and good music. Favorite part is the introductions when they announce the officers in the prison and they’re booed by the prisoners. Solid, not necessarily mind blowing but some good moments. </p>

<p>H, 1951: Classic B. B. King, with great trademark vocals and guitar work. By this point in King’s career, black blues artists like King, Muddy Waters and Howling Wolf were starting to be known to rock audiences thanks to credit being given to them by bands like The Rolling Stones and Cream, and thanks to publications such as Rolling Stone. B.B. King was really the first musician who spoke to his audience through his guitar as much as through his vocals, and paved the way for everyone who followed. </p>

<img alt="" src="images/aquemini.png">

<p>#500</p>

<h2>Aquemini</h2>

<p><em>LaFace, 1998</em></p>

<p>B, 1966: Wow, what a fantastic album. I remember listening to Speakerboxxx/The Love Below when it first came out, but had never listened to Aquamini. So many great songs and I love the DJ-like intros. Still sounds creative and original. My pick: “Liberation”, but easily five or six great songs here. </p>

<p>C, 2002: This was a surprisingly good album. Being a drummer, I always look at beats and/or grooves and the beats made on this album are great and propel the album. I love this album and it was a great start to the 500. Will definitely get a second listen. </p>

<p>H, 1951: I guess the beauty of Rap &#8212; and, more broadly, of much of the music made by African Americans &#8212; is that is starts with the most basic language, and experiences &#8212; words and events most often viewed by white Euro-American culture as “common” &#8212; and then uses those as building blocks to create lasting artistic works of great beauty, sophistication and power. Robert Johnson, Duke Ellington, OutKast &#8212; there’s a single thread running through all of them. I love the overall sound of this album and its sprawling intensity, as well as its verbal sophistication. I think “Synthesizer” might be my favorite track. </p>
