<p>&#8220;C&#8221; is a drummer with an idea. Listen to Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time before he graduates high school in the spring of 2020. </p>
<p>&#8220;B&#8221; is his uncle and thought, &#8220;Hmmm, sounds interesting, maybe I should listen to those too.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8221; is somehow related to both &#8220;C&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221; but none of us can work out exactly how. &#8220;H&#8221; loves music and knows the early stuff. He wanted in. </p>
<p>&#8220;C&#8221; was born in the 2000's. &#8220;B&#8221; was born in the 1960's. &#8220;H&#8221; was born in the 1950's. </p>
<p>We decided to record our thoughts and notes on the albums as we go along, starting at # 500 and working our way towards the top. Most of these are jots and hot-takes, and a way to record the process. We will not always agree, but that's kinda the point. </p>
<p>We have a lot to get through, so keep up. </p>

<p>About the RS 500. </p>
<p>The RS 500 was assembled by the editors of Rolling Stone, based on the results of two extensive polls. In 2003, Rolling Stone asked a panel of 271 artists, producers, industry executives and journalists to pick the greatest albums of all time. In 2009, they asked a similar group of 100 experts to pick the best albums of the 2000s. From those results, Rolling Stone created this new list of the greatest albums of all time. </p>
<p>Find the list here: </p>
<h2></h2>
<p>We know this is biased to Western Culture, and we will not necessarily agree with all these even being on the list. But hey, it is a list. Letâ€™s get spinnin' and streamin'&#8230;. </p>
