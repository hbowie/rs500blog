</em></p>

<p class="card-text body-text">B, 1966: Newman for me is synonymous with ‘Toy Story’, ‘Cars’, or the whole Pixar library for that matter. Listened to this one with a lot of trepidation, and I was right to. There is a fauxness to these songs I just can’t shake. Track pick, since I have to, is ‘Birmingham’. </p>

<p class="card-text body-text">C, 2002: Classic Newman. I’ve listened to this album before and loved it then. His stuff always holds up in my book. “Birmingham” is such a classic; can’t go wrong with it. But my pick is “Naked Man”. </p>

<div class="card-text body-text"><p>H, 1951: Newman's genius as a singer/songwriter has always been a childlike ability to project himself inside a whole universe of other characters seemingly at will, while simultaneously seeing their realities through their eyes, as well as through his own. He can do this to great comic effect, but also to great emotive effect, and is perhaps most powerful when he shifts from one to another without warning, in the blink of an eye. </p>
<p>In later years, he's projected himself inside a whole universe of cartoon characters dreamt up by animators at Pixar, endearing himself to children and parents (and his bankers) along the way, but he's had to hide away the bulk of his talents, and his past achievements, in order to contrive this new kid-friendly persona. </p>
<p>(This contrast was on full view a few years ago when Pauline and I saw Newman as part of the Woodland Park Zoo concert series. The audience was full of rapt children and parents with food spread out on blankets, with Newman having to continuously apologize during his between-songs banter for the frequent profanities that were a natural and irredeemable part of his speech patterns.) </p>
<p>This album sounded like a strange mixture even when it was first released. Newman had three uncles who wrote film scores in Hollywood, and his instrumentation and musical ornamentation and favored compositional style come straight from that tradition. Newman's vocals, on the other hand, sound like straight, white Southern drawl, acquired from his childhood years in Louisiana. And then the lyrics are penetrating social commentary as well as empathetic projection into various imagined characters from the American South. It probably feels out of place among other albums on this list, because it never started any trends, didn't ride on anyone else's coattails, didn't win any popularity contests, and never tried to pander to any audience other than the one composed of intelligent, enlightened listeners: in other words, an unabashed original. </p>
<p>In hindsight, much of this album sounds prophetic, and even more relevant today than when it was first released. If you listen carefully, and understand the viewpoints of these characters, then you can understand why Trump was elected in 2016. Listen to the satiric words Newman puts in his Redneck character's mouth for most of the first song, and it's easy to look down on the character's obvious ignorance from a detached distance. But then the same character turns his gaze northward, and his observations start to strike home. Singing about black urban populations in the North and the West, and their alleged freedoms, he throws out these sarcastic words: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes he's free to be put in a cage  <br />
 In Harlem in New York City,  <br />
 And he's free to be put in a cage  <br />
 On the South Side of Chicago,  <br />
 And the West Side,  <br />
 And he's free to be put in a cage,  <br />
 In Hough in Cleveland,  <br />
 And he's free to be put in a cage  <br />
 In East St. Louis,  <br />
 And he's free to be put in a cage  <br />
 In Fillmore in San Francisco,  <br />
 And he's free to be put in a cage  <br />
 In Roxbury in Boston&#8230;.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the album is similarly insightful, and blisteringly accurate. </p>
<p>Newman has always had the ability to write music that makes us feel. This album is a gift from from a point in his career when he was also trying to make us think. It's worth your while to try to get inside its grooves. </p></div>
