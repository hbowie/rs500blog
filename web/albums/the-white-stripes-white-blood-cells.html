<p class="card-text"><em>Sympathy for the Record Industry, 2001</em></p>

<p class="card-text body-text">B, 1966: Phenomenal record with rock talent and passion oozing out. My pick: “We’re Going To Be Friends”. I know it is sappy as hell, and not really indicative of the record, but it is just so cute and happy. I added it to my morning playlist. </p>

<p class="card-text body-text">C, 2002: I knew this record already from hearing it when I was a kid but it’s still great. It’s crazy how much sound can be covered by two musicians and have it not sound cheesy or like it’s missing something. Favorite song off of it is probably either “Hotel Yorba” or “Now Mary”. </p>

<p class="card-text body-text">H, 1951: Hadn’t heard this before, but enjoyed listening to it, and might even listen to it again. Lots of short songs, interesting, sometimes deceptively simple lyrics, often from the perspective of a male with one foot still in childhood, and one foot tentatively testing the waters of what it might mean to be an adult. The songs are a bit sketch-like, both in terms of lyrics and music, seemingly tossed off casually rather than being fully developed, but that is part of the album’s appeal. Hard to resist the charm of “We’re going to be friends,” which is so simple but so convincing a picture of what it’s like to be a kid happy to have a friend you can walk to school with. The whole thing reminds me a bit of Jonathan Richman. </p>
