</em></p>

<p class="card-text body-text">B, 1966: A few iconic tracks, but also some quite average songs on this record. Listening to this, it is evident that Morrison was not nearly the poet so many have suggested he was. His best songs are simple ones, with great psychedelic blues behind him. Track: “Strange Days” definitely stands out. </p>

<p class="card-text body-text">C, 2002: I’ve never really listened to the doors but this is a super cool album. “You’re lost little girl” and “when the music’s over” are my top picks. Would listen to album again. </p>

<div class="card-text body-text"><p>H, 1951: I was never a huge fan of The Doors. For one, I've always had problems with artists of all media who lacked any sense of humor — and Jim Morrison always insisted you take him Very Seriously. But also The Doors were a band apart. None of the band members collaborated in any way with other bands of the era, even others based in Southern California. Neither did they influence, or were they influenced by, any of their peers, as far as I can tell. Finally, I guess, they lacked any sense of balance. They believed in taking things to extremes. In a sense, I suppose, they were Dionysian fundamentalists, and I'm generally turned off by any sort of fundamentalism. </p>
<p>With all that being said, this is their second album. It's not as strong as their debut, but certainly has some good stuff, and Morrison's vocals, Manzarek's keyboards, Krieger's guitar and Densmore's drumming certainly combine to form a heady and compelling brew on many of these tracks. I've always liked &#8220;People Are Strange&#8221; — but stay away from &#8220;Horse Latitudes,&#8221; whatever you do. </p></div>
