<p class="card-text"><em>MCA,
<a href="../index-by-year.html#year-1973">1973</a>, rock, southern
</em></p>

<p class="card-text body-text">B, 1966: A great, super fun, thoroughly rock record. It makes me want to grow a mullet, play air guitar, and party on (and note that ironically none of the band sport a mullet). But the songs have more depth than just that, there is substance here too. While it is tempting to pick the beautiful ‘Simple Man’ for my track, I just can’t ignore ‘Freebird’. </p>

<p class="card-text body-text">C, 2002: Great album with some unquestionable hits on it. To me, this is exactly how I expected the band to sound based on the songs Ialready knew; I don&apos;t know how else to put it, it’s a classic sound. I agree with H’s comment about being a great debut (didn’t even know it was their debut album before, thanks H!). My pick is “Gimme Three Steps” cause it reminds me of “Victoria” by the kinks for some reason (I think rebel guitar part and key signature? Not sure). </p>

<div class="card-text body-text"><p>H, 1951: This has to be one of the strongest debut albums of all time, featuring a distinctive guitar-laden sound, catchy, original songs, a strong Southern identity, and a really wide-ranging set of material.  Of course, not every group gets to have its first outing produced by Al Kooper, but most of the credit needs to go to the band, who allegedly ushered their famous producer out to the curb when he tried to tell them that &#8220;Simple Man&#8221; was too weak to be worth recording. </p>
<p>Also, despite the sort of simple-minded hedonism and braggadocio often associated with young rock bands of this era — and especially Southern rock bands — the thematic veins being mined here are rich and rewarding. You've got a song from a boy/man being wrongfully accused of fathering a friend's child, a sad lament to lost love, another boy/man trying to escape being shot by a jealous husband, a son heeding his mother's advice to avoid sin and be a simple kind of man, resentment about the elites wasting money on moon shots and foreign wars while citizens at home are still having to live in the ghetto, a warning about the dangers of alcohol, and an ode to freedom, even while recognizing its costs.  </p>
<p>Definitely a rock classic. </p></div>
