<a href="../index-by-year.html#year-1981">1981</a>, girl group, new wave, punk
</em></p>

<p class="card-text body-text">B, 1966: A few of the songs from this album were in heavy rotation as a part of my early high-school soundtrack. I am not sure we took it all that seriously at the time, but it was just light, happy, optimistic, fresh fun to balance all the seriousness we believed we were about. Now hearing it anew, I hear a strong, vivacious female voice behind all that early 80’s new-wave post-punk pop freshness, perhaps also appreciating more how hard it may have been for them to make it. Good to see a record like this make the list. “Our Lips Are Sealed” is a great song, though I like the version co-writer Terry Hall did with Fun Boy Three a bit better. So for me track choice has to be the supremely hooky, “We Got The Beat”, which is also where you hear some of the punk background of the band come through. </p>

<p class="card-text body-text">C, 2002: It’s alright. Kinda cheesy to me. </p>

<div class="card-text body-text"><p>H, 1951: What a great album! Solid from start to finish. Classic cover. A throwback to the sounds of the sixties in many ways, but updated to express a modern sense of female empowerment and solidarity, while still keeping a fresh sense of SoCal fun. It's as if the Bride that Nick Lowe Knew (When She Used to Rock 'n Roll) decided to never get married and instead form a band with four of her best friends. It's no wonder this album caused a seven-year-old Drew Barrymore to decide &#8220;Yes! I like girls who rock!&#8221; What was so great about the Go-Go's was that they were flat-out rockers without sacrificing one bit of their right to also be modern girls. </p></div>
