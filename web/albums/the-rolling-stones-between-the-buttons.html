</em></p>

<p class="card-text body-text">B, 1966: At first I was wondering why this album was so far down the list, then I realized I was listening to the U.S. release instead of the U.K. release. So I switched over. Still a decent record, but missing some of the iconic Stones tracks, and definitely a few duds. A reminder that great bands also have some misses along the way. Going with ‘Who’s Been Sleeping Here?’ </p>

<p class="card-text body-text">C, 2002: Not 100% sure why this is on here out of all the Stones records there are but it’s here on the list, so therefore we listen. “Miss Amanda Jones” is my pick. </p>

<div class="card-text body-text"><p>H, 1951: Although it feels like the Stones have been around forever, and have staked out a certain ground for that entire time, the band actually went through a number of transformations over its first decade or so. Brian Jones was neither lead singer nor songwriter, but his eclectic musical interests and multi-instrumental capabilities were a strong influence on the group's sound for a few years and, as a result, this album features less of the blues-based rock that the Stones were known for a bit earlier, as well as later. The combination of Brian's musical embellishment with some solid originals penned by Jagger and Richards make this a stand-out album in the group's catalog. It's hard to believe now, but &#8220;Let's Spend the Night Together&#8221; was considered too explicit for many media outlets when it came out in '67, and spelling this request out was one of the many things that gave the Stones a reputation for being &#8220;bad boys&#8221; compared to The Beatles. </p></div>
